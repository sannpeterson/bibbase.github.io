	abstract = {Purpose
To determine if there is a correlation between intrahepatic tumor volume and future liver remnant (FLR) hypertrophy after portal vein embolization (PVE).
Materials and Methods
Forty-four consecutive patients with hepatocellular carcinoma or metastatic colorectal cancer who underwent PVE from 2009 to 2017 and who had complete imaging follow-up were retrospectively reviewed. To maximize the accuracy of tumor volume measurements, 11 patients were excluded for having more than 5 intrahepatic tumors. Volumetric analyses of the patient livers before and after PVE, as well as pre-embolization intrahepatic tumor burden, were performed.
Results
A significant inverse correlation was observed between tumor volume and FLR hypertrophy after PVE (Spearman ρ = -0.53, P = .002). Initial FLR volume was also inversely correlated with subsequent hypertrophy (P = .01). Fourteen patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy 1 month prior to intervention. The number of chemotherapy cycles did not affect hypertrophy (P = .57). Patients with cirrhosis experienced less FLR hypertrophy than patients without cirrhosis (P = .02).
Conclusions
Patients with large intrahepatic tumor burden may experience limited FLR hypertrophy.},

	abstract = {Purpose
To evaluate the influence of percutaneous cryoablation for renal cell carcinoma on function of the affected kidney.
Materials and Methods
Between June 2016 and September 2017 at our institution, 12 inoperable patients underwent 15 cryoablation sessions for 17 small renal tumors. Of these, 9 patients who underwent 11 sessions of cryoablation were the focus of this study. For those patients, time-dependent changes in postoperative renal function were investigated by a retrospective review of clinical records. Evaluated were the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and scintigraphy using 99m technetium-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (99mTc-MAG3) before and 1 week, 1–2 months, and more than 6 months after cryoablation.
Results
Mean baseline eGFR was 76.88 ± 29.82 mL/min/1.73 m2 (mean ± standard deviation; range, 23.4–112.5). Mean eGFR 1 week, 1–2 months, and more than 6 months after cryoablation were 74.56 ± 26.68 mL/min/1.73 m2 (21.0–101.1), 69.5 ± 25.28 mL/min/1.73 m2 (24.1–105.6), and 75.08 ± 26.25 mL/min/1.73 m2 (29.0–107.3), respectively. Changes were statistically insignificant (P = .6044, P = .6699, and P = .9038, respectively). Regarding split renal function, the mean baseline contribution of the affected kidney determined by 99mTc-MAG3 was 47.27\% ± 6.14 (38.8\%–57.0\%). Mean contributions of the affected kidney 1 week after, 1–2 months after, and more than 6 months after cryoablation were 44.40\% ± 5.37 (38.3\%–53.6\%), 44.57\% ± 6.52 (34.35\%–55.0\%), and 45.41\% ± 7.77 (34.4\%–56.5\%), respectively. Differences from baseline were significant for the earliest 2 periods (P = .0473 and P = .0334, respectively) but not the later period (P = .2532).
Conclusions
Results suggested that total renal function does not worsen after cryoablation; however, function of the affected kidney worsened after cryoablation but later partially recovered.},

	abstract = {Image-guided percutaneous ablation is considered best in the treatment of early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Ablation is potentially curative, minimally invasive, and easily repeatable for recurrence. Ethanol injection used to be the standard in ablation. However, radiofrequency ablation has recently been the most prevailing ablation method for HCC. Many investigators have reported that radiofrequency ablation is superior to ethanol injection, from the viewpoints of treatment response, local tumor curativity, and overall survival. New-generation microwave ablation can create a larger ablation volume in a shorter time period. Further comparison studies are, however, mandatory between radiofrequency ablation and microwave ablation, especially in terms of complications and long-term survival. Irreversible electroporation, which is a non-thermal ablation method that delivers short electric pulses to induce cell death due to apoptosis, requires further studies, especially in terms of long-term outcomes. It is considerably difficult to compare outcomes in ablation with those in surgical resection. However, radiofrequency ablation seems to be a satisfactory alternative to resection for HCC 3 cm or smaller in Child-Pugh class A or B cirrhosis. Furthermore, radiofrequency ablation may be a first-line treatment in HCC 2 cm or smaller in Child-Pugh class A or B cirrhosis. Various innovations would further improve outcomes in ablation. Training programs may be effective in providing an excellent opportunity to understand basic concepts and learn cardinal skills for successful ablation. Sophisticated ablation would be more than an adequate alternative of surgery for small- and possibly middle-sized HCC.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common liver malignancy worldwide. However, present studies of its multiple gene interaction and cellular pathways still could not explain the initiation and development of HCC perfectly. To find the key genes and miRNAs as well as their potential molecular mechanisms in HCC, microarray data GSE22058, GSE25097, and GSE57958 were analyzed.
METHODS: The microarray datasets GSE22058, GSE25097, and GSE57958, including mRNA and miRNA profiles, were downloaded from the GEO database and were analyzed using GEO2R. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses were performed using the DAVID database, and the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the Cytoscape software. Finally, miRDB was applied to predict the targets of the differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs).
RESULTS: A total of 115 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found in HCC, including 52 up-regulated genes and 63 down-regulated genes. The gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses from DAVID showed that up-regulated genes were significantly enriched in chromosome segregation and cell division, while the down-regulated genes were mainly involved in complement activation, protein activation cascades, carboxylic acid metabolic processes, oxoacid metabolic processes, and the immune response. From the PPI network, the 18 nodes with the highest degree were screened as hub genes. Among them, ESR1 was found to have close interactions with FOXO1, CXCL12, and GNAO1. In addition, a total of 64 DEMs were identified, which included 58 up-regulated miRNAs and 6 down-regulated miRNAs. ESR1 was potentially targeted by five miRNAs, including hsa-mir-18a and hsa-mir-221.
CONCLUSIONS: The roles of DEMs like hsa-mir-221 in HCC through interactions with DEGs such as ESR1 and CXCL12 may provide new clues for the diagnosis and treatment of HCC patients.},

	abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the principal causes of cancer‑associated mortality worldwide. The high incidence of liver metastasis is the leading risk factor of mortality in patients with CRC, and the mechanisms of CRC liver metastasis are poorly understood. In the present study, 7 datasets, including 3 gene expression profile datasets and 4 microRNA (miRNA) expression profile datasets were downloaded from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to identify potential key genes and miRNAs, which may be candidate biomarkers for CRC liver metastasis. Differentially expressed (DE) genes (DEGs) and DE miRNAs of primary CRC tumor tissues and liver metastatic CRC tumor tissues were selected using the GEO2R tool. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genome pathway enrichment analyses were conducted using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery online database. Furthermore, Cytoscape with cytoHubba and the Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) plug‑in were used to visualize a protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network for these DEGs, and to screen hub genes and gene modules in the PPI network. In addition, the online databases, TargetScan, miRanda, PITA, miRWalk and miRDB, were used to identify the target genes of the DE miRNAs. In the present study, 141 DEGs (97 upregulated and 44 downregulated) and 3 DE miRNAs (2 upregulated and 1 downregulated) were screened from the 3 gene expression microarray datasets and 4 miRNA expression microarray datasets, respectively. In total, 10 hub genes with a high degree of connectivity were selected from the PPI network, including albumin (ALB), coagulation factor II (F2), thrombin, apolipoprotein H (APOH), serpin family C member 1 (SERPINC1), apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1), α‑1‑microglobulin/bikunin precursor (AMBP), apolipoprotein C3 (APOC3), plasminogen (PLG), α‑2 HS glycoprotein (AHSG) and apolipoprotein B (APOB). The most important module was detected in the PPI network using the MCODE plug‑in. A total of 20 DEGs were identified to be potential target genes of these DE miRNAs, and novel miRNA‑DEGs regulatory axes were constructed. In vitro experiments were performed to demonstrate that miR‑885 promoted CRC cell migration by, at least partially, decreasing the expression of von Willebrand factor (vWF) and insulin‑like growth factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP5). In conclusion, by using integrated bioinformatics analysis and in vitro experiments, key candidate genes were identified and novel miRNA‑mRNA regulatory axes in CRC liver metastasis were constructed, which may improve understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying CRC liver metastasis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Liver fibrosis, characterized with the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, represents the final common pathway of chronic liver inflammation. Ever-increasing evidence indicates microRNAs (miRNAs) dysregulation has important implications in the different stages of liver fibrosis. However, our knowledge of miRNA-gene regulation details pertaining to such disease remains unclear.
METHODS: The publicly available Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets of patients suffered from cirrhosis were extracted for integrated analysis. Differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) and genes (DEGs) were identified using GEO2R web tool. Putative target gene prediction of DEMs was carried out using the intersection of five major algorithms: DIANA-microT, TargetScan, miRanda, PICTAR5 and miRWalk. Functional miRNA-gene regulatory network (FMGRN) was constructed based on the computational target predictions at the sequence level and the inverse expression relationships between DEMs and DEGs. DAVID web server was selected to perform KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. Functional miRNA-gene regulatory module was generated based on the biological interpretation. Internal connections among genes in liver fibrosis-related module were determined using String database. MiRNA-gene regulatory modules related to liver fibrosis were experimentally verified in recombinant human TGFβ1 stimulated and specific miRNA inhibitor treated LX-2 cells.
RESULTS: We totally identified 85 and 923 dysregulated miRNAs and genes in liver cirrhosis biopsy samples compared to their normal controls. All evident miRNA-gene pairs were identified and assembled into FMGRN which consisted of 990 regulations between 51 miRNAs and 275 genes, forming two big sub-networks that were defined as down-network and up-network, respectively. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that up-network was prominently involved in several KEGG pathways, in which "Focal adhesion", "PI3K-Akt signaling pathway" and "ECM-receptor interaction" were remarked significant (adjusted p{\textless}0.001). Genes enriched in these pathways coupled with their regulatory miRNAs formed a functional miRNA-gene regulatory module that contains 7 miRNAs, 22 genes and 42 miRNA-gene connections. Gene interaction analysis based on String database revealed that 8 out of 22 genes were highly clustered. Finally, we experimentally confirmed a functional regulatory module containing 5 miRNAs (miR-130b-3p, miR-148a-3p, miR-345-5p, miR-378a-3p, and miR-422a) and 6 genes (COL6A1, COL6A2, COL6A3, PIK3R3, COL1A1, CCND2) associated with liver fibrosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Our integrated analysis of miRNA and gene expression profiles highlighted a functional miRNA-gene regulatory module associated with liver fibrosis, which, to some extent, may provide important clues to better understand the underlying pathogenesis of liver fibrosis.},

Here we used two breeds of male newborn piglets with distinct metabolic characteristics, Large White (LW) and Erhualian (EHL), to delineate the hepatic expression profiles of mRNA with microarray and miRNAs with both deep sequencing and microarray, and to analyze the functional relevance of integrated miRNA and mRNA expression in relation to the physiological and biochemical parameters. EHL had significantly lower body weight and liver weight at birth, but showed elevated serum levels of total cholesterol (TCH), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), as well as higher liver content of cholesterol. Higher serum cortisol and lower serum insulin and leptin were also observed in EHL piglets. Compared to LW, 30 up-regulated and 18 down-regulated miRNAs were identified in the liver of EHL, together with 298 up-regulated and 510 down-regulated mRNAs (FDR{\textless}10\%). RT-PCR validation of some differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) further confirmed the high-throughput data analysis. Using a target prediction algorithm, we found significant correlation between the up-regulated miRNAs and down-regulated mRNAs. Moreover, differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which are involved in proteolysis, were predicted to be mediated by DEMs. These findings provide new information on the miRNA and mRNA profiles in porcine liver, which would shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the breed-specific traits in the pig, and may serve as a basis for further investigation into the biological functions of miRNAs in porcine liver.},

Marek's disease virus (MDV)-induced T-cell lymphoma is also an excellent biomedical model for neoplasia research. Recently, miRNAs have been demonstrated to play crucial roles in mediating neoplastic transformation. To investigate host miRNA expression profiles in the tumor transformation phase of MDV infection, we performed deep sequencing in two MDV-infected samples (tumorous spleen and MD lymphoma from liver), and two non-infected controls (non-infected spleen and lymphocytes). In total, 187 and 16 known miRNAs were identified in chicken and MDV, respectively, and 17 novel chicken miRNAs were further confirmed by qPCR. We identified 28 down-regulated miRNAs and 11 up-regulated miRNAs in MDV-infected samples by bioinformatic analysis. Of nine further tested by qPCR, seven were verified. The gga-miR-181a, gga-miR-26a, gga-miR-221, gga-miR-222, gga-miR-199*, and gga-miR-140* were down-regulated, and gga-miR-146c was up-regulated in MDV-infected tumorous spleens and MD lymphomas. In addition, 189 putative target genes for seven differentially expressed miRNAs were predicted. The luciferase reporter gene assay showed interactions of gga-miR-181a with MYBL1, gga-miR-181a with IGF2BP3, and gga-miR-26a with EIF3A. Differential expression of miRNAs and the predicted targets strongly suggest that they contribute to MDV-induced lymphomagenesis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Porcine cytomegalovirus (PCMV) is an immunosuppressive virus that mainly inhibits T-lymphocyte and macrophage immune functions; it has significantly damaged the farming industry. Although recent studies have shown that miRNAs play important roles in immune responses, the regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs during immunosuppressive virus infection remain unclear.
METHODS: In this study, porcine small-RNA transcriptomes of PCMV-infected and uninfected vital organs were first characterised by high-throughput sequencing. miRDeep2 software was used to predict novel pig-encoded miRNAs. To verify the accuracy of the high-throughput sequencing results, stem-loop qRT-PCR was performed on 12 significantly DE miRNAs. The physical and functional interactions between the immune-related target genes of the DE miRNAs in PCMV-infected organs were analysed using the STRING database.
RESULTS: In total, 306 annotated and 295 novel miRNAs were identified from PCMV-infected and uninfected porcine organs, respectively, through alignment with known Sus scrofa pre-miRNAs. Overall, 92, 107, 95, 77 and 111 miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed in lung, liver, spleen, kidney and thymus after PCMV infection, respectively. According to Gene Ontology enrichment analysis, target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs associated with immune system processes, regulation of biological processes and metabolic processes were enriched in every sample. Integrated expression analysis of the differentially expressed miRNAs and their target mRNAs in PCMV-infected thymus showed that the significant differential expression of specific miRNAs under the pressure of PCMV infection in central immune organs interfered with the expression of genes involved in important immune-related signalling pathways, thus promoting the viral infection.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first comprehensive analysis of the responses of host small-RNA transcriptomes to PCMV infection in vital porcine organs. It provides new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs during infection by immunosuppressive viruses.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) simultaneously target many transcripts through partial complementarity binding, and have emerged as a key type of post-transcriptional regulator for gene expression. How miRNA accomplishes its pleiotropic effects largely depends on its expression and its target repertoire. Previous studies discovered thousands of miRNAs and numerous miRNA target genes mainly through computation and prediction methods which produced high rates of false positive prediction. The development of Argonaute cross-linked immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-Seq) provides a system to effectively determine miRNA target genes. Likewise, the accuracy of dissecting the transcriptional regulation of miRNA genes has been greatly improved by chromatin immunoprecipitation of the transcription factors coupled with sequencing (ChIP-Seq). Elucidation of the miRNA target repertoire will provide an in-depth understanding of the functional roles of microRNA pathways. To reliably reconstruct a miRNA-mediated regulatory network, we established a computational framework using publicly available, sequence-based transcription factor-miRNA databases, including ChIPBase and TransmiR for the TF-miRNA interactions, along with miRNA-target databases, including miRTarBase, TarBase and starBase, for the miRNA-target interactions. We applied the computational framework to elucidate the miRNA-mediated regulatory network in the Mir122a⁻/⁻ mouse model, which has an altered transcriptome and progressive liver disease.
RESULTS: We applied our computational framework to the expression profiles of miRNA/mRNA of Mir122a⁻/⁻ mutant mice and wild-type mice. The miRNA-mediated network involves 40 curated TFs contributing to the aberrant expression of 65 miRNAs and 723 curated miRNA target genes, of which 56\% was found in the differentially-expressed genes of Mir122a--mice. Hence, the regulatory network disclosed previously-known and also many previously-unidentified miRNA-mediated regulations in mutant mice. Moreover, we demonstrate that loss of imprinting at the chromosome 12qF1 region is associated with miRNA overexpression in human hepatocellular carcinoma and stem cells, suggesting initiation of precancerous changes in young mice deficient in miR-122. A group of 9 miRNAs was found to share miR-122 target genes, indicating synergy between miRNAs and target genes by way of multiplicity and cooperativity.
CONCLUSIONS: The study provides significant insight into miRNA-mediated regulatory networks. Based on experimentally verified data, this network is highly reliable and effective in revealing previously-undetermined disease-associated molecular mechanisms. This computational framework can be applied to explore the significant TF-miRNA-miRNA target interactions in any complex biological systems with high degrees of confidence.},

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a regulatory role in viral infection and may be involved in the mammalian immune response. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of host miRNA expression in TGEV-infected swine testis (ST) cells. Deep sequencing generated 3,704,353 and 2,763,665 reads from uninfected ST cells and infected ST cells, respectively. The reads were aligned to known Sus scrofa pre-miRNAs in miRBase 19, identifying 284 annotated miRNAs. Certain miRNAs were differentially regulated during TGEV infection. 59 unique miRNAs displayed significant differentially expression between the normal and TGEV-infected ST cell samples: 15 miRNAs were significantly up-regulated and 44 were significantly down-regulated. Stem-loop RT-PCR was carried out to determine the expression levels of specific miRNAs in the two samples, and the results were consistent with those of sequencing. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of host target genes demonstrated that the differentially expressed miRNAs are involved in regulatory networks, including cellular process, metabolic process, immune system process. This is the first report of the identification of ST cell miRNAs and the comprehensive analysis of the miRNA regulatory mechanism during TGEV infection, which revealed the miRNA molecular regulatory mechanisms for the viral infection, expression of viral genes and the expression of immune-related genes.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common malignancy of the liver and recent studies have revealed that circular RNA (circRNA) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of HCC. Some circRNAs may act as a microRNA (miRNA) sponge to affect miRNA activities in the regulation of messenger RNA (mRNA) expression. However, the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network in HCC remains largely unknown. MATERIAL AND METHODS The circRNA expression profiles (GSE94508 and GSE97332), miRNA and mRNA expression profile (GSE22058) were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus microarray data and then a circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network in HCC was constructed. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of differentially expressed (DE) genes were performed. The functional circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory modules were constructed using cytoHubba plugin based on Cytoscape and KEGG enrichment analysis. RESULTS The network contained 60 circRNA-miRNA pairs and 4982 miRNA-mRNA pairs, including 29 circRNAs, 16 miRNAs, and 1249 mRNAs. GO and KEGG pathway analysis revealed the network might be involved in the procession of carcinogenesis such as cell proliferation, cell cycle, and p53 signaling pathway. In addition, 3 top ranked circRNAs (hsa\_circ\_0078279, hsa\_circ\_0007456, and hsa\_circ\_0004913) related networks were identified to be highly correlated with the pathogenesis of HCC. Furthermore, the functional circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory modules were constructed based on the 3 top-ranked circRNAs and those DE genes enriched in carcinogenesis related pathways. CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that a specific circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network is associated with the carcinogenesis of HCC, which might aid in the identification of molecular biomarkers and therapeutic targets for HCC.},

We assessed the levels of 829 mature miRNAs, of which 32 were significantly differentially expressed. Statistical analysis indicates that six of these miRNAs regulate a significant proportion of their in silico predicted target mRNAs. Three of these miRNAs (miR-26a, miR-122, and miR-130a) were down-regulated in HCC, and their up-regulated gene targets are primarily associated with aberrant cell proliferation that involves DNA replication, transcription and nucleotide metabolism. The other three miRNAs (miR-21, miR-93, and miR-221) were up-regulated in HCC, and their down-regulated gene targets are primarily involved in metabolism and immune system processes. We further found evidence for a coordinated miRNA-induced regulation of important cellular processes, a finding to be considered when designing therapeutic applications based on miRNAs.},

Although much useful gene expression profiling data for tumor cell lines is available, microarray data for miRNAs and mRNAs in the human HepG2 cell line have only been compared with that of other cell lines separately. The relationship between miRNAs and mRNAs in integrated expression profiles for HepG2 cells is still unknown. To explore the miRNA-mRNA correlations in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, we performed miRNA and mRNA expression profiling in HepG2 cells and normal liver HL-7702 cells at the genome scale using next-generation sequencing technology. We identified 193 miRNAs that are differentially expressed in these two cell lines. Of these, 89 miRNAs were down-regulated in HepG2 cells compared with HL-7702 cells, while 104 miRNAs were up-regulated. We also observed 3035 mRNAs that are significantly dys-regulated in HepG2 cells. We then performed an integrated analysis of the expression data for differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs and found several miRNA-mRNA pairs that are significantly correlated in HepG2 cells. Further analysis suggested that these differentially expressed genes were enriched in four tumorigenesis-related signaling pathways, namely, ErbB, JAK-STAT, mTOR, and WNT, which until now had not been fully reported.

Here we used the Yorkshire pig as a control to analyze the Tibetan pig-specific liver miRNAome, and for preliminary investigation of differentially expressed miRNAs participating in metabolism. A comprehensive analysis of Tibetan and Yorkshire pig liver miRNAomes by small RNA sequencing identified 362 unique miRNAs. Among these, 304 were co-expressed in both libraries, and 10 and 48 miRNAs were specifically expressed. Differential expression analysis of miRNAs, miRNA target prediction and KEGG analysis revealed that differentially expressed miRNAs were associated mainly with the metabolism of glucose, lipid and protein. Six differentially expressed miRNAs (miR-34a, miR-326, miR-1, miR-335, miR-185 and miR-378) participating in the metabolism of glucose and lipid were identified. Additionally, qPCR results revealed that a lower expression of miR-34a in Tibetan pig liver may promote gluconeogenesis by increasing the expression of Sirtuin type 1 (Sirt1); a lower expression of miR-1 in Tibetan pig liver may promote the synthesis and accumulation of lipid by increasing the expression of Liver X receptor α (LXRα); and a lower expression of miR-185 in Tibetan pig liver may promote the uptake of cholesterol from blood and secretion of bile by increasing the expression of the scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI). Our results provide new information and understanding of porcine miRNA profiles, which may help explain the regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs in the metabolic functions of Tibetan pig liver, and provide new biomarkers to assist in the development of Tibetan pig breeding characteristics.},

	abstract = {Since metastasis is the major cause of death for cancer patients, there is an urgent need to develop new therapies to control hematogenous dissemination of cancer cells. Previously we and others demonstrated a novel mechanism that allows tumors to escape from the host immune response by expressing PD-L1 which can negatively regulate immune response through the interaction with PD-1, an immunoinhibitory receptor belonging to the CD28 family. In this study, we report that hematogenous spread of poorly immunogenic B16 melanoma cells to the liver was inhibited in PD-1-deficient mice. After inoculation to spleen, PD-L1 was induced on tumor cells, which did not express PD-L1 in vitro. As compared with wild-type mice, intrasplenic injection of B16 cells into PD-1-deficient mice showed enhanced induction of effector T cells in spleen, prolonged T cell proliferation and cytokine production, and augmented homing of effector T cells to tumor sites in the liver, resulting in accumulation of effector T cells in the tumor sites. PD-1 blockade by genetic manipulation or antibody treatment inhibited not only hematogenous dissemination of B16 melanoma cells to the liver on the C57BL/6 background, but also dissemination of CT26 colon cancer cells to the lung on the BALB/c background. These results suggest that PD-1 blockade may be a powerful tool for treatment of hematogenous spread of various tumor cells.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fruit has since long been advocated as a healthy source of many nutrients, however, the high content of sugars in fruit might be a concern.
OBJECTIVES: To study effects of an increased fruit intake compared with similar amount of extra calories from nuts in humans.
METHODS: Thirty healthy non-obese participants were randomized to either supplement the diet with fruits or nuts, each at +7 kcal/kg bodyweight/day for two months. Major endpoints were change of hepatic fat content (HFC, by magnetic resonance imaging, MRI), basal metabolic rate (BMR, with indirect calorimetry) and cardiovascular risk markers.
RESULTS: Weight gain was numerically similar in both groups although only statistically significant in the group randomized to nuts (fruit: from 22.15 ± 1.61 kg/m(2) to 22.30 ± 1.7 kg/m(2), p = 0.24 nuts: from 22.54 ± 2.26 kg/m(2) to 22.73 ± 2.28 kg/m(2), p = 0.045). On the other hand BMR increased in the nut group only (p = 0.028). Only the nut group reported a net increase of calories (from 2519 ± 721 kcal/day to 2763 ± 595 kcal/day, p = 0.035) according to 3-day food registrations. Despite an almost three-fold reported increased fructose-intake in the fruit group (from 9.1 ± 6.0 gram/day to 25.6 ± 9.6 gram/day, p{\textless}0.0001, nuts: from 12.4 ± 5.7 gram/day to 6.5 ± 5.3 gram/day, p = 0.007) there was no change of HFC. The numerical increase in fasting insulin was statistical significant only in the fruit group (from 7.73 ± 3.1 pmol/l to 8.81 ± 2.9 pmol/l, p = 0.018, nuts: from 7.29 ± 2.9 pmol/l to 8.62 ± 3.0 pmol/l, p = 0.14). Levels of vitamin C increased in both groups while α-tocopherol/cholesterol-ratio increased only in the fruit group.
CONCLUSIONS: Although BMR increased in the nut-group only this was not linked with differences in weight gain between groups which potentially could be explained by the lack of reported net caloric increase in the fruit group. In healthy non-obese individuals an increased fruit intake seems safe from cardiovascular risk perspective, including measurement of HFC by MRI.

By using chakras, a clinician can appreciate the integration of human organ systems, the neuroendocrine system, and personality attributes (both positive and negative) associated with each chakra. Objective: To create personality archetypes from chakras that have practical clinical value. Design: By assigning chakras to the 5-Phase elements on a pentagon per Dr. Cross, it was possible to connect a series of negative or positive emotions, from one to another, using the familiar Ko cycles and Shen cycles, to form theoretical personality archetypes and then to demonstrate archetype usefulness in a sample clinical case. The patient was being treated with Japanese acupuncture. The main outcome sought was to determine the personality types according to the 5-Phase theory with chakra energy centers included and to demonstrate the application of this system in the clinical case. Results: Fourteen personality archetypes-seven composed of positive emotions and seven composed of negative emotions-were identified. Easy-to-remember names and familiar patterns of emotion that are mapped to the nodes of a pentagon (adapted to chakra acupuncture) were produced. The clinical case showed that the patient's work life conflicts resulted in negative archetype emotional patterns (anger, scarcity, lack of self-esteem) consistent with the presentation of irritable bowel syndrome, insomnia, liver illness, and osteoarthritis. Conclusions: Personality archetypes have clinical value for understanding the emotions associated with illness.},

	abstract = {The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasing worldwide. In some patients with NAFLD, isolated steatosis can progress to advanced stages with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis, increasing the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Furthermore, NAFLD is believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of common disorders such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In this Review, we highlight novel concepts related to diagnosis, risk prediction, and treatment of NAFLD. First, because NAFLD is a heterogeneous disease, the advanced stages of which seem to be strongly affected by comorbidities such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, early use of reliable, non-invasive diagnostic tools is needed, particularly in patients with insulin resistance or diabetes, to allow the identification of patients at different disease stages. Second, although the strongest genetic risk alleles for NAFLD (ie, the 148Met allele in PNPLA3 and the 167Lys allele in TM6SF2) are associated with increased liver fat content and progression to NASH and cirrhosis, these alleles are also unexpectedly associated with an apparent protection from cardiovascular disease. If consistent across diverse populations, this discordance in NAFLD-related risk prediction between hepatic and extrahepatic disease might need to be accounted for in the management of NAFLD. Third, drug treatments assessed in NAFLD seem to differ with respect to cardiometabolic and antifibrotic efficacy, suggesting the need to better identify and tailor the most appropriate treatment approach, or to use a combination of approaches. These emerging concepts could contribute to the development of a multidisciplinary approach for endocrinologists and hepatologists working together in the management of NAFLD.},

	abstract = {Glutamine synthetase, encoded by the gene GLUL, is an enzyme that converts glutamate and ammonia to glutamine. It is expressed by endothelial cells, but surprisingly shows negligible glutamine-synthesizing activity in these cells at physiological glutamine levels. Here we show in mice that genetic deletion of Glul in endothelial cells impairs vessel sprouting during vascular development, whereas pharmacological blockade of glutamine synthetase suppresses angiogenesis in ocular and inflammatory skin disease while only minimally affecting healthy adult quiescent endothelial cells. This relies on the inhibition of endothelial cell migration but not proliferation. Mechanistically we show that in human umbilical vein endothelial cells GLUL knockdown reduces membrane localization and activation of the GTPase RHOJ while activating other Rho GTPases and Rho kinase, thereby inducing actin stress fibres and impeding endothelial cell motility. Inhibition of Rho kinase rescues the defect in endothelial cell migration that is induced by GLUL knockdown. Notably, glutamine synthetase palmitoylates itself and interacts with RHOJ to sustain RHOJ palmitoylation, membrane localization and activation. These findings reveal that, in addition to the known formation of glutamine, the enzyme glutamine synthetase shows unknown activity in endothelial cell migration during pathological angiogenesis through RHOJ palmitoylation.},

However, evidence of probiotic gut mucosal colonization efficacy remains sparse and controversial. We metagenomically characterized the murine and human mucosal-associated gastrointestinal microbiome and found it to only partially correlate with stool microbiome. A sequential invasive multi-omics measurement at baseline and during consumption of an 11-strain probiotic combination or placebo demonstrated that probiotics remain viable upon gastrointestinal passage. In colonized, but not germ-free mice, probiotics encountered a marked mucosal colonization resistance. In contrast, humans featured person-, region- and strain-specific mucosal colonization patterns, hallmarked by predictive baseline host and microbiome features, but indistinguishable by probiotics presence in stool. Consequently, probiotics induced a transient, individualized impact on mucosal community structure and gut transcriptome. Collectively, empiric probiotics supplementation may be limited in universally and persistently impacting the gut mucosa, meriting development of new personalized probiotic approaches.},

These signals have been identified and studied in multiple organs, including the liver, pancreas, lung, heart, bone, bone marrow, central nervous system, retina and some cancers1-4. Here we use the developing liver as a model organ to study angiocrine signals5,6, and show that the growth rate of the liver correlates both spatially and temporally with blood perfusion to this organ. By manipulating blood flow through the liver vasculature, we demonstrate that vessel perfusion activates β1 integrin and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3). Notably, both β1 integrin and VEGFR3 are strictly required for normal production of hepatocyte growth factor, survival of hepatocytes and liver growth. Ex vivo perfusion of adult mouse liver and in vitro mechanical stretching of human hepatic endothelial cells illustrate that mechanotransduction alone is sufficient to turn on angiocrine signals. When the endothelial cells are mechanically stretched, angiocrine signals trigger in vitro proliferation and survival of primary human hepatocytes. Our findings uncover a signalling pathway in vascular endothelial cells that translates blood perfusion and mechanotransduction into organ growth and maintenance.},

	abstract = {CRISPR-Cas-based genome editing holds great promise for targeting genetic disorders, including inborn errors of hepatocyte metabolism. Precise correction of disease-causing mutations in adult tissues in vivo, however, is challenging. It requires repair of Cas9-induced double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) breaks by homology-directed mechanisms, which are highly inefficient in nondividing cells. Here we corrected the disease phenotype of adult phenylalanine hydroxylase (Pah)enu2 mice, a model for the human autosomal recessive liver disease phenylketonuria (PKU)1, using recently developed CRISPR-Cas-associated base editors2-4. These systems enable conversion of C∙G to T∙A base pairs and vice versa, independent of dsDNA break formation and homology-directed repair (HDR). We engineered and validated an intein-split base editor, which allows splitting of the fusion protein into two parts, thereby circumventing the limited cargo capacity of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. Intravenous injection of AAV-base editor systems resulted in Pahenu2 gene correction rates that restored physiological blood phenylalanine (L-Phe) levels below 120 µmol/l [5]. We observed mRNA correction rates up to 63\%, restoration of phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme activity, and reversion of the light fur phenotype in Pahenu2 mice. Our findings suggest that targeting genetic diseases in vivo using AAV-mediated delivery of base-editing agents is feasible, demonstrating potential for therapeutic application.},

The effect of AMPK activity on satellite cell-mediated muscle growth and regeneration after injury is also reviewed. Together, the current data indicate that AMPK does play an important role in regulating muscle mass and regeneration, with AMPKα1 playing a prominent role in stimulating anabolism and in regulating satellite cell dynamics during regeneration, and AMPKα2 playing a potentially more important role in regulating muscle degradation during atrophy.},

Silencing of PRMT6 promoted the tumor-initiating, metastasis, and therapy resistance potential of HCC cell lines and patient-derived organoids. Consistently, loss of PRMT6 expression aggravated liver tumorigenesis in a chemical-induced HCC PRMT6 knockout (PRMT6-/-) mouse model. Integrated transcriptome and protein-protein interaction studies revealed an enrichment of genes implicated in RAS signaling and showed that PRMT6 interacted with CRAF on arginine 100, which decreased its RAS binding potential and altered its downstream MEK/ERK signaling.

Such HCC was microbiota-dependent and observed in multiple strains of dysbiotic mice but not in germ-free nor antibiotics-treated mice. Furthermore, consumption of an inulin-enriched high-fat diet induced both dysbiosis and HCC in wild-type (WT) mice. Inulin-induced HCC progressed via early onset of cholestasis, hepatocyte death, followed by neutrophilic inflammation in liver. Pharmacologic inhibition of fermentation or depletion of fermenting bacteria markedly reduced intestinal SCFA and prevented HCC. Intervening with cholestyramine to prevent reabsorption of bile acids also conferred protection against such HCC.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Unresectable locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative (hormone-receptor-negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]-negative) breast cancer is an aggressive disease with poor outcomes. Nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab)-paclitaxel may enhance the anticancer activity of atezolizumab.
METHODS: In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) patients with untreated metastatic triple-negative breast cancer to receive atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel or placebo plus nab-paclitaxel; patients continued the intervention until disease progression or an unacceptable level of toxic effects occurred. Stratification factors were the receipt or nonreceipt of neoadjuvant or adjuvant taxane therapy, the presence or absence of liver metastases at baseline, and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression at baseline (positive vs. negative). The two primary end points were progression-free survival (in the intention-to-treat population and PD-L1-positive subgroup) and overall survival (tested in the intention-to-treat population; if the finding was significant, then it would be tested in the PD-L1-positive subgroup).
RESULTS: Each group included 451 patients (median follow-up, 12.9 months). In the intention-to-treat analysis, the median progression-free survival was 7.2 months with atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel, as compared with 5.5 months with placebo plus nab-paclitaxel (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.80; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.69 to 0.92; P=0.002); among patients with PD-L1-positive tumors, the median progression-free survival was 7.5 months and 5.0 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95\% CI, 0.49 to 0.78; P{\textless}0.001). In the intention-to-treat analysis, the median overall survival was 21.3 months with atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel and 17.6 months with placebo plus nab-paclitaxel (hazard ratio for death, 0.84; 95\% CI, 0.69 to 1.02; P=0.08); among patients with PD-L1-positive tumors, the median overall survival was 25.0 months and 15.5 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95\% CI, 0.45 to 0.86). No new adverse effects were identified. Adverse events that led to the discontinuation of any agent occurred in 15.9\% of the patients who received atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel and in 8.2\% of those who received placebo plus nab-paclitaxel.
CONCLUSIONS: Atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel prolonged progression-free survival among patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer in both the intention-to-treat population and the PD-L1-positive subgroup. Adverse events were consistent with the known safety profiles of each agent. (Funded by F. Hoffmann-La Roche/Genentech; IMpassion130 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02425891 .).},

Beneficial effects of increased NAD+ levels and sirtuin activation on mitochondrial homeostasis, organismal metabolism and lifespan have been established across species. Here we show that α-amino-β-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde decarboxylase (ACMSD), the enzyme that limits spontaneous cyclization of α-amino-β-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde in the de novo NAD+ synthesis pathway, controls cellular NAD+ levels via an evolutionarily conserved mechanism in Caenorhabditis elegans and mouse. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of ACMSD boosts de novo NAD+ synthesis and sirtuin 1 activity, ultimately enhancing mitochondrial function. We also characterize two potent and selective inhibitors of ACMSD. Because expression of ACMSD is largely restricted to kidney and liver, these inhibitors may have therapeutic potential for protection of these tissues from injury. In summary, we identify ACMSD as a key modulator of cellular NAD+ levels, sirtuin activity and mitochondrial homeostasis in kidney and liver.},

The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling functions as an integrative rheostat that orchestrates various cellular and metabolic activities that shape tissue homeostasis. Whether these two fundamental signaling pathways couple to exert physiological functions still remains mysterious. Using a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening, we discover that mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling suppresses canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Deficiency in tuberous sclerosis complex 1/2 (TSC1/2), core negative regulators of mTORC1 activity, represses Wnt/β-catenin target gene expression, which can be rescued by RAD001. Mechanistically, mTORC1 signaling regulates the cell surface level of Wnt receptor Frizzled (FZD) in a Dishevelled (DVL)-dependent manner by influencing the association of DVL and clathrin AP-2 adaptor. Sustained mTORC1 activation impairs Wnt/β-catenin signaling and causes loss of stemness in intestinal organoids ex vivo and primitive intestinal progenitors in vivo. Wnt/β-catenin-dependent liver metabolic zonation gene expression program is also down-regulated by mTORC1 activation. Our study provides a paradigm that mTORC1 signaling cell autonomously regulates Wnt/β-catenin pathway to influence stem cell maintenance.},

After adjustment for body mass index in the regression analysis, the associations at all except three loci remained. The lead variants at the distinct loci explained up to 7.0\% of the variance in circulating amounts of CRP.

We reviewed the medical records of 140 patients from 2010 to 2014. The laboratory parameters and SCD complications were compared between the first and last visits based on HU use. Fifty patients (36\%) never took HU or suspended HU ("no HU" group). Among patients taking {\textless}15 mg/kg/day HU on their first visit, half remained at the same dose, and the other half increased to ≥15 mg/kg/day. Among patients taking ≥15 mg/kg/day, 17\% decreased to {\textless}15 mg/kg/day, and 83\% stayed at ≥15 mg/kg/day. The "no HU" group had fewer episodes of VOC and ACS. Both HU treatment groups had a reduction in both complications (p {\textless} 0.0001). This improvement was observed in all SCD phenotypes. The white blood cell (WBC) counts were found to be lower, and HbF increased in both HU groups (p = 0.004, 0.001). The maximal HbF response to HU in HbS/β⁺-thalassemia was 20\%, similar to those observed for HbSS (19\%) and HbS/β⁰-thalassemia (22\%). HbS/β⁺-thalassemia could have a similar disease severity as HbSS or HbS/β⁰-thalassemia. Patients with HbS/β⁰-thalassemia or HbS/β⁺-thalassemia phenotypes responded to HU.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: T-cell exhaustion, or an impaired capacity to secrete cytokines and proliferate with overexpression of immune checkpoint receptors, occurs during chronic viral infections but has also been observed in tumors, including hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). We investigated features of exhaustion in CD8+ T cells isolated from HCC specimens.
METHODS: We obtained HCC specimens, along with adjacent non-tumor tissues and blood samples, from 90 patients who underwent surgical resection at Asan Medical Center (in Seoul, Korea) from April 2016 through April 2018. Intrahepatic lymphocytes and tumor-infiltrating T cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells were sorted by flow cytometry into populations based on expression level of programmed cell death 1 (PDCD1 or PD1): PD1-high, PD1-intermediate, and PD1-negative. Sorted cells were analyzed by RNA-seq. Proliferation and production of interferon gamma (IFNG) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) by CD8+ T cells were measured in response to anti-CD3 and antibodies against immune checkpoint receptors including PD1, hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 2 (HAVCR2 or TIM3), lymphocyte activating 3 (LAG3), or isotype control. Tumor-associated antigen-specific CD8+ T cells were identified using HLA-A*0201 dextramers. PDL1 expression on tumor tissue was assessed by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: PD1-high, PD1-intermediate, and PD1-negative CD8+ T cells from HCCs had distinct gene expression profiles. PD1-high cells expressed higher levels of genes that regulate T-cell exhaustion than PD1-intermediate cells. PD1-high cells expressed TIM3 and LAG3, and a low proportion was TCF1+, TBEThigh/eomesoderminlow, and CD127+. PD1-high cells produced the lowest amounts of IFNG and TNF upon anti-CD3 stimulation. Differences in proportions of PD1-high CD8+ T cells led to the identification of 2 subgroups of HCCs; HCCs with a larger proportion of PD1-high cells were more aggressive than HCCs with a smaller proportion. HCCs with a larger proportion of PD1-high cells had higher levels of predictive biomarkers of response to anti-PD1 therapy. Incubation of CD8+ T cells from HCCs with high proportions of PD1-high cells with antibodies against PD1 and TIM3 or LAG3 further restored proliferation and production of IFNG and TNF in response to anti-CD3.
CONCLUSIONS: We found HCC specimens to contain CD8+ T cells that express different levels of PD1. HCCs with high proportions of PD1-high CD8+ T cells express TIM3 and/or LAG3 and produce low levels of IFNG and TNF in response to anti-CD3. Incubation of these cells with antibodies against PD1 and TIM3 or LAG3 further restore proliferation and production of cytokines; HCCs with high proportions of PD1-high CD8+ T cells might be more susceptible to combined immune checkpoint blockade-based therapies.},

Here we show that compositional and functional changes in the gut microbiota contribute to a number of CR-induced metabolic improvements and promote fat browning. Mechanistically, these effects are linked to a lower expression of the key bacterial enzymes necessary for the lipid A biosynthesis, a critical lipopolysaccharide (LPS) building component. The decreased LPS dictates the tone of the innate immune response during CR, leading to increased eosinophil infiltration and anti-inflammatory macrophage polarization in fat of the CR animals. Genetic and pharmacological suppression of the LPS-TLR4 pathway or transplantation with Tlr4-/- bone-marrow-derived hematopoietic cells increases beige fat development and ameliorates diet-induced fatty liver, while Tlr4-/- or microbiota-depleted mice are resistant to further CR-stimulated metabolic alterations.

In July 2018, tafenoquine was approved in the USA for the radical cure of P. vivax malaria in patients aged ≥ 16 years who are receiving appropriate antimalarial therapy for acute P. vivax malaria. Subsequently, in August 2018, tafenoquine was approved in the USA for the prophylaxis of malaria in patients aged ≥ 18 years.

We invasively examined the effects of multi-strain probiotics or autologous fecal microbiome transplantation (aFMT) on post-antibiotic reconstitution of the murine and human mucosal microbiome niche. Contrary to homeostasis, antibiotic perturbation enhanced probiotics colonization in the human mucosa but only mildly improved colonization in mice. Compared to spontaneous post-antibiotic recovery, probiotics induced a markedly delayed and persistently incomplete indigenous stool/mucosal microbiome reconstitution and host transcriptome recovery toward homeostatic configuration, while aFMT induced a rapid and near-complete recovery within days of administration. In vitro, Lactobacillus-secreted soluble factors contributed to probiotics-induced microbiome inhibition. Collectively, potential post-antibiotic probiotic benefits may be offset by a compromised gut mucosal recovery, highlighting a need of developing aFMT or personalized probiotic approaches achieving mucosal protection without compromising microbiome recolonization in the antibiotics-perturbed host.},

There will be an estimated 18.1 million new cancer cases (17.0 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and 9.6 million cancer deaths (9.5 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) in 2018. In both sexes combined, lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer (11.6\% of the total cases) and the leading cause of cancer death (18.4\% of the total cancer deaths), closely followed by female breast cancer (11.6\%), prostate cancer (7.1\%), and colorectal cancer (6.1\%) for incidence and colorectal cancer (9.2\%), stomach cancer (8.2\%), and liver cancer (8.2\%) for mortality. Lung cancer is the most frequent cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among males, followed by prostate and colorectal cancer (for incidence) and liver and stomach cancer (for mortality). Among females, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, followed by colorectal and lung cancer (for incidence), and vice versa (for mortality); cervical cancer ranks fourth for both incidence and mortality. The most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, however, substantially vary across countries and within each country depending on the degree of economic development and associated social and life style factors. It is noteworthy that high-quality cancer registry data, the basis for planning and implementing evidence-based cancer control programs, are not available in most low- and middle-income countries. The Global Initiative for Cancer Registry Development is an international partnership that supports better estimation, as well as the collection and use of local data, to prioritize and evaluate national cancer control efforts.

We discover that epithelial cells have increased chromosome missegregation outside of their native tissues. Using organoid culture systems, we show that tissue architecture, specifically integrin function, is required for accurate chromosome segregation. We find that tissue architecture enhances the correction of merotelic microtubule-kinetochore attachments, and this is especially important for maintaining chromosome stability in the polyploid liver. We propose that disruption of tissue architecture could underlie the widespread chromosome instability across epithelial cancers. Moreover, our findings highlight the extent to which extracellular context can influence intrinsic cellular processes and the limitations of cell culture systems for studying cells that naturally function within a tissue.},

We now show that caspase-2, whose expression is ER-stress inducible and elevated in human and mouse NASH, controls the buildup of hepatic-free cholesterol and triglycerides by activating sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP) in a manner refractory to feedback inhibition. Caspase-2 colocalizes with site 1 protease (S1P) and cleaves it to generate a soluble active fragment that initiates SCAP-independent SREBP1/2 activation in the ER. Caspase-2 ablation or pharmacological inhibition prevents diet-induced steatosis and NASH progression in ER-stress-prone mice. Caspase-2 inhibition offers a specific and effective strategy for preventing or treating stress-driven fatty liver diseases, whereas caspase-2-generated S1P proteolytic fragments, which enter the secretory pathway, are potential NASH biomarkers.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previously reported results from the phase 3 CheckMate 067 trial showed a significant improvement in objective responses, progression-free survival, and overall survival with nivolumab plus ipilimumab or nivolumab alone compared with ipilimumab alone in patients with advanced melanoma. The aim of this report is to provide 4-year updated efficacy and safety data from this study.
METHODS: In this phase 3 trial, eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with previously untreated, unresectable, stage III or stage IV melanoma, known BRAFV600 mutation status, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive intravenous nivolumab 1 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for four doses, followed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks, or nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks plus placebo, or ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for four doses plus placebo. Randomisation was done via an interactive voice response system with a permuted block schedule (block size of six) and stratification by PD-L1 status, BRAF mutation status, and metastasis stage. The patients, investigators, study site staff, and study funder were masked to the study drug administered. The co-primary endpoints were progression-free survival and overall survival. Efficacy analyses were done on the intention-to-treat population, whereas safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. The results presented in this report reflect the 4-year update of the ongoing study with a database lock date of May 10, 2018. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01844505.
FINDINGS: Between July 3, 2013, and March 31, 2014, 945 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to nivolumab plus ipilimumab (n=314), nivolumab (n=316), or ipilimumab (n=315). Median follow-up was 46·9 months (IQR 10·9-51·8) in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab group, 36·0 months (10·5-51·4) in the nivolumab group, and 18·6 months (7·6-49·5) in the ipilimumab group. At a minimum follow-up of 48 months from the date that the final patient was enrolled and randomised, median overall survival was not reached (95\% CI 38·2-not reached) in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab group, 36·9 months (28·3-not reached) in the nivolumab group, and 19·9 months (16·9-24·6) in the ipilimumab group. The hazard ratio for death for the combination versus ipilimumab was 0·54 (95\% CI 0·44-0·67; p{\textless}0·0001) and for nivolumab versus ipilimumab was 0·65 (0·53-0·79; p{\textless}0·0001). Median progression-free survival was 11·5 months (95\% CI 8·7-19·3) in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab group, 6·9 months (5·1-10·2) in the nivolumab group, and 2·9 months (2·8-3·2) in the ipilimumab group. The hazard ratio for progression-free survival for the combination versus ipilimumab was 0·42 (95\% CI 0·35-0·51; p{\textless}0·0001) and for nivolumab versus ipilimumab was 0·53 (0·44-0·64; p{\textless}0·0001). Treatment-related grade 3-4 adverse events were reported in 185 (59\%) of 313 patients who received nivolumab plus ipilimumab, 70 (22\%) of 313 who received nivolumab, and 86 (28\%) of 311 who received ipilimumab. The most common treatment-related grade 3 adverse events were diarrhoea in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab group (29 [9\%] of 313) and in the nivolumab group (nine [3\%] of 313) and colitis in the ipilimumab group (23 [7\%] of 311); the most common grade 4 adverse event in all three groups was increased lipase (15 [5\%] of 313 in the combination group, ten [3\%] of 313 in the nivolumab group, and four [1\%] of 311 in the ipilimumab group). Serious adverse events were not analysed for the 4-year follow-up. In total for the study, there were four treatment-related deaths: two in the nivolumab plus ipilimumab group (one cardiomyopathy and one liver necrosis), one in the nivolumab group (neutropenia), and one in the ipilimumab group (colon perforation). No additional treatment-related deaths have occurred since the previous (3-year) analysis.
INTERPRETATION: The results of this analysis at 4 years of follow-up show that a durable, sustained survival benefit can be achieved with first-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab or nivolumab alone in patients with advanced melanoma.

Among several mouse models, some exhibit the key pathophysiologic as well as histopathologic criteria for human NASH, whereas others may be useful to address specific questions. Models based on over-nutrition with adipose restriction/inflammation and metabolic complications, particularly insulin resistance may be most useful to interrogate critical etiopathogenic factors. In-depth pathologic description is required for all models. Some demonstrate hepatocyte ballooning, which can be confused with microvesicular steatosis, while demonstration of an inflammatory infiltrate and pattern of liver fibrosis compatible with human NASH is desirable in models used for pharmacologic testing. When mice with specific genetic strains or mutations that cause over-eating consume a diet enriched with fat, modest amounts of cholesterol and/or simple sugars ("Western diet") they readily develop obesity with liver disease similar to human NASH, including significant fibrosis. Purely dietary models, such as high fat/high cholesterol, Western diet and choline-deficient amino acid defined are similarly promising. We share concern about using models without weight gain, adipose pathology or insulin resistance/hyperinsulinemia and with inadequate documentation of liver pathology. NASH-related fibrosis is a key endpoint in trials of possible therapies. When studied for this purpose, NASH models should be reproducible, show steatohepatitis (ideally with ballooning) and at least focal bridging fibrosis, while metabolic factors/disordered lipid partitioning should contribute to etiopathogenesis. Since murine models are increasingly used to explore pharmacologic therapies for NASH, we propose a minimum set of requirements that investigators, drug companies and journals should consider to optimise their translational value.

	abstract = {Purpose
To investigate the differences in immune responses between cryoablation and irreversible electroporation (IRE) in a preclinical mouse model.
Material and Methods
A mouse pancreatic cancer cell line (PANC-2) was implanted in the bilateral flanks of mice, and tumor-bearing mice were divided into 6 groups. One of the tumors was ablated either with contact cryoablation using an argon-cooled cryoablation probe for 1 minute at 5\% power or by IRE for a total of 64 100-μs-duration, 1250-V/cm2 pulses with 100-ms spacing. The contralateral tumors in the same animal served as controls. At immediate, 6, 12, and 24 hours after ablation, the tumors were processed for immunostaining with F480 (macrophages), CD3 (T cells), and CD-56 (natural killer cells) antibodies.
Results
CD3 staining demonstrated significantly more T cells in the IRE group than in the cryoablation group at 6 hours (45 vs 16; P = .027), 12 hours (67 vs 33; P = .020), and 24 hours (161 vs 94; p = .003), with almost a 2-fold increase at every time point. Although the mean number of natural killer cells in the treated tumors was higher, no significant differences were observed between the 2 groups at any of the time points. A significant difference was observed in F480 positivity between the cryoablation group and the IRE group at 12 hours (210 vs 356; P = .0004) and 24 hours (220 vs 328; P = .04), respectively.
Conclusions
In a mouse model of pancreatic cancer, IRE evokes a more robust infiltration of macrophages and T cells than cryoablation within 24 hours.},

The disease encompasses {\textgreater}10 histological and molecular subtypes, of which clear cell RCC (ccRCC) is most common and accounts for most cancer-related deaths. Although somatic VHL mutations have been described for some time, more-recent cancer genomic studies have identified mutations in epigenetic regulatory genes and demonstrated marked intra-tumour heterogeneity, which could have prognostic, predictive and therapeutic relevance. Localized RCC can be successfully managed with surgery, whereas metastatic RCC is refractory to conventional chemotherapy. However, over the past decade, marked advances in the treatment of metastatic RCC have been made, with targeted agents including sorafenib, sunitinib, bevacizumab, pazopanib and axitinib, which inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor (VEGFR), and everolimus and temsirolimus, which inhibit mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), being approved. Since 2015, agents with additional targets aside from VEGFR have been approved, such as cabozantinib and lenvatinib; immunotherapies, such as nivolumab, have also been added to the armamentarium for metastatic RCC. Here, we provide an overview of the biology of RCC, with a focus on ccRCC, as well as updates to complement the current clinical guidelines and an outline of potential future directions for RCC research and therapy.},

Tissue dominant effects are first removed computationally in order to define these subtypes, which reveal common processes-reflecting in part tumor microenvironmental influences-driving cellular behavior across tumor lineages. Six of the subtypes feature a mixture of represented cancer types as defined by tissue or cell of origin. Differences in patient survival and in the manifestation of specific pathways-including hypoxia, metabolism, NRF2-ARE, Hippo, and immune checkpoint-can further distinguish the subtypes. Immune checkpoint markers and molecular signatures of macrophages and T cell infiltrates are relatively high within distinct subsets of each cancer type studied. The pan-urologic cancer genomic subtypes would facilitate information sharing involving therapeutic implications between tissue-oriented domains.Urological cancers have disparate tissues and cells of origin but share many molecular features.

We also detected CD8+ T cell reactivity against predicted neoepitopes after isolation of cells from a blood sample taken almost 3 years after the tumors were resected.

	abstract = {Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is characterized by stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF1), and mutations in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene. Additionally, in about 40\% of ccRCC cases the mutation in PBRM1 (POLYBROMO1) gene coding for a non-core subunit of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex was found suggesting potential impairment of this complex function in ccRCC. In this study we assessed the extent to which the core SWI/SNF complex subunit - INI1 (hSNF5/SMARCB1) is affected in ccRCC and whether it has any consequences on the development of this type of cancer. The evaluation of INI1 protein level in samples from 50 patients with diagnosed ccRCC, including three displaying rhabdoid features, showed the INI1 positive staining in rhabdoid cells while the conventional ccRCC cells exhibited reduced INI1 level. This indicated the rhabdoid component of ccRCC as distinct from other known rhabdoid tumors. The reduced INI1 protein level observed in all conventional ccRCC cases used in this study correlated with decreased SMARCB1 gene expression at the transcript level. Consistently, the overexpression of INI1 protein in A498 ccRCC cell line resulted in the elevation of endogenous SMARCB1 transcript level indicating that the INI1-dependent regulatory feedback loop controlling expression of this gene is affected in ccRCC Moreover, the set of INI1 target genes including i.e. CXCL12/CXCR7/CXCR4 chemokine axis was identified to be affected in ccRCC. In summary, we demonstrated that the inactivation of INI1 may be of high importance for ccRCC development and aggressiveness.},

This study evaluated the potential for fusion-derived CASQs to be a source of tumor neoepitopes, and determined their relationship to patterns of immune signatures in prostate cancer patients.Experimental Design: A computational strategy was used to identify CASQs and their corresponding predicted MHC class I epitopes using RNA-Seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas of prostate tumors. In vitro peptide-specific T-cell expansion was performed to identify CASQ-reactive T cells. A multivariate analysis was used to relate patterns of in silico-predicted tumor-infiltrating immune cells with prostate tumors harboring these mutational events.Results: Eighty-seven percent of tumors contained gene fusions with a mean of 12 per tumor. In total, 41\% of fusion-positive tumors were found to encode CASQs. Within these tumors, 87\% gave rise to predicted MHC class I-binding epitopes. This observation was more prominent when patients were stratified into low- and intermediate/high-risk categories. One of the identified CASQ from the recurrent TMPRSS2:ERG type VI fusion contained several high-affinity HLA-restricted epitopes. These peptides bound HLA-A*02:01 in vitro and were recognized by CD8+ T cells. Finally, the presence of fusions and CASQs were associated with expression of immune cell infiltration.Conclusions: Mutanome analysis of gene fusion-derived CASQs can give rise to patient-specific predicted neoepitopes. Moreover, these fusions predicted patterns of immune cell infiltration within a subgroup of prostate cancer patients. Clin Cancer Res; 23(24); 7596-607. ©2017 AACR.},

METHODS: We enrolled 1360 patients who underwent nephrectomy in our institution from 2001 to 2010. The cutoff values for HALP, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio were defined by using X-tile software. Survival was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method, with differences analyzed by the log-rank test. Multivariate Cox proportional-hazards model was used to evaluate the prognostic significance of HALP for RCC.
RESULTS: Low HALP was significantly associated with worse clinicopathologic features. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests revealed that HALP was strongly correlated with cancer specific survival (P {\textless} 0.001) and Cox multivariate analysis demonstrated that preoperative HALP was independent prognostic factor for cancer specific survival (HR = 1.838, 95\%CI:1.260-2.681, P = 0.002). On predicting prognosis by nomogram, the risk model including TNM stage, Fuhrman grade and HALP score was more accurate than only use of TNM staging.
CONCLUSIONS: HALP was closely associated with clinicopathologic features and was an independent prognostic factor of cancer-specific survival for RCC patients undergoing nephrectomy. A nomogram based on HALP could accurately predict prognosis of RCC.},

The convenient access to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database allows for large-scale global gene expression profiling and database mining for potential correlation between genes and overall survival of a variety of malignancies including GBM. Previous reports have shown that tumor microenvironment cells and the extent of infiltrating immune and stromal cells in tumors contribute significantly to prognosis. Immune scores and stromal scores calculated based on the ESTIMATE algorithm could facilitate the quantification of the immune and stromal components in a tumor. To better understand the effects of genes involved in immune and stromal cells on prognosis, we categorized GBM cases in the TCGA database according to their immune/stromal scores into high and low score groups, and identified differentially expressed genes whose expression was significantly associated with prognosis in GBM patients. Functional enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction networks further showed that these genes mainly participated in immune response, extracellular matrix, and cell adhesion. Finally, we validated these genes in an independent GBM cohort from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA). Thus, we obtained a list of tumor microenvironment-related genes that predict poor outcomes in GBM patients.},

However, thus far, rich cellular information carried in tissue samples has not been thoroughly characterized from RNA-Seq data. Therefore, it would expand our horizons to better understand the biological processes of the body by incorporating a cell-centric view of tissue transcriptome. Here, a computational model named seq-ImmuCC was developed to infer the relative proportions of 10 major immune cells in mouse tissues from RNA-Seq data. The performance of seq-ImmuCC was evaluated among multiple computational algorithms, transcriptional platforms, and simulated and experimental datasets. The test results showed its stable performance and superb consistency with experimental observations under different conditions. With seq-ImmuCC, we generated the comprehensive landscape of immune cell compositions in 27 normal mouse tissues and extracted the distinct signatures of immune cell proportion among various tissue types. Furthermore, we quantitatively characterized and compared 18 different types of mouse tumor tissues of distinct cell origins with their immune cell compositions, which provided a comprehensive and informative measurement for the immune microenvironment inside tumor tissues.

The TIS has been shown to enrich for patients who respond to the anti-PD1 agent pembrolizumab. To explore this immune phenotype within and across tumor types, we applied the TIS algorithm to over 9000 tumor gene expression profiles downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). As expected based on prior evidence, tumors with known clinical sensitivity to anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade had higher average TIS scores. Furthermore, TIS scores were more variable within than between tumor types, and within each tumor type a subset of patients with elevated scores was identifiable although with different prevalence associated with each tumor type, the latter consistent with the observed clinical responsiveness to anti PD-1 blockade. Notably, TIS scores only minimally correlated with mutation load in most tumors and ranking tumors by median TIS score showed differing association to clinical sensitivity to PD-1/PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) blockade than ranking of the same tumors by mutation load. The expression patterns of the TIS algorithm genes were conserved across tumor types yet appeared to be minimally prognostic in most cancers, consistent with the TIS score serving as a pan-cancer measurement of the inflamed tumor phenotype. Characterization of the prevalence and variability of TIS will lead to increased understanding of the immune status of untreated tumors and may lead to improved indication selection for testing immunotherapy agents.},

We assessed immune checkpoint marker expression, lymphocytic infiltrate, and associated mutational profiles in a cohort of small intestine and pancreatic NETs.
METHODS: We assessed expression of PDCD1 (PD-1), CD274 (PD-L1), and PDCD1LG2 (PD-L2) in archival tissue from 64 small intestine (SINETs) and 31 pancreatic NETs (pNET). We additionally assessed T-cell infiltrates, categorizing T-cell subsets based on expression of the T-cell markers CD3, CD8, CD45RO (PTPRC), or FOXP3. Finally, we explored associations between immune checkpoint marker expression, lymphocytic infiltrate, and tumor mutational profiles.
RESULTS: Expression of PD-1 or PD-L1 in small intestine or pancreatic NET was rare, whereas expression of PD-L2 was common in both NET subtypes. T-cell infiltrates were more abundant in pNET than in SINET. We found no clear associations between immune checkpoint marker expression, immune infiltrates, and specific mutational profile within each tumor type.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide an initial assessment of the immune environment of well-differentiated NETs. Further studies to define the immunologic differences between pNET and SINET, as well as the role of PD-L2 in these tumors, are warranted.},

Given the emergence of effective immune therapies against many cancers, reliable predictors of response are needed. One method of determining response is by evaluating immune cell populations from treated and untreated tumor samples. The amount of material obtained from tumor biopsies can be limited; therefore, gene-based or protein-based analyses may be attractive because they require minimal tissue. Cell-specific signatures are being analyzed with use of the latest technologies, including NanoString's nCounter technology, intracellular staining flow cytometry, cytometry by time-of-flight, RNA-Seq, and barcoding antibody-based protein arrays. These signatures provide information about the contributions of specific types of immune cells to bulk tumor samples. To date, both tumor tissue and immune cells have been analyzed for molecular expression profiles that can assess genes and proteins that are specific to immune cells, yielding results of varying specificity. Here, we discuss the importance of profiling tumor tissue and immune cells to identify immune-cell-associated genes and proteins and specific gene profiles of immune cells.

Thus, the rules of tumor antigen recognition remain incompletely understood. Here, we analyzed neopeptides, immune activity, and clinical outcome from 6,324 patients across 27 tumor types. We characterized a class of "alternatively defined neopeptides" (ADNs), which are mutant peptides predicted to bind MHC (class I or II) with improved affinity relative to their nonmutated counterpart. ADNs are abundant and molecularly distinct from CDNs. The load of ADNs correlated with intratumoral T-cell responses and immune suppression, and ADNs were also strong predictors of patient survival across tumor types.

After small RNA-seq, several analyses were performed, including classifier evaluation, obesity-related inquiries, survival analysis using publicly available datasets, comparisons to the current literature and ingenuity pathway analyses. In a comparison of tumour vs. normal, 182 miRNAs were found with significant differential expression; miR-155 was of particular interest as it classified all ccRCC samples correctly and correlated well with tumour size (R² = 0.83); miR-155 also predicted poor survival with hazard ratios of 2.58 and 1.81 in two different TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) datasets in a univariate model. However, in a multivariate Cox regression analysis including age, sex, cancer stage and histological grade, miR-155 was not a statistically significant survival predictor.

It is imperative to develop feasible biomarker for identifying responsive candidates and guiding precise immunotherapy for HGSOC patients. Here, we analysed genomic data of patients with HGSOCs to depict their immunological phenotype of tumour microenvironment (TME) and figure out the major determinants of immunogenicity. In comparison with other solid tumours, we observed the lowest levels of PD-L1, total mutation burden (TMB) and cytolytic molecules in HGSOCs. Surprisingly, TMB is not certainly positively related to tumour immune response as it failed to predict the response to ICIs in a considerable portion of patients in previous clinical trials. By a machine learning approach in search of biomarkers for immunotherapy implications for HGSOCs, we identified the ten most dominant factors determining the immunogenicity of HGSOCs. Interestingly, we found that BRCA1 mutated tumours presented a potent immunogenic phenotype, independent of TMB, meeting the criteria of both our dominant factors and the determinants of immunogenicity established before. Our findings provide evidence that BRCA1-mutation may be served as a predictive biomarker in guiding ICI therapies for the patients with HGSOCs.},

	abstract = {The immunologic landscape of tumors has been continuously unveiled, providing a new look at the interactions between cancer cells and the immune system. Emerging tumor cells are constantly eliminated by the immune system, but some cells establish a long-term equilibrium phase leading to tumor immunoediting and, eventually, evasion. During this process, tumor cells tend to acquire more mutations. Bearing a high mutation burden leads to a greater number of neoantigens with the potential to initiate an immune response. Although many tumors evoke an immune response, tumor clearance by the immune system does not occur due to a suppressive tumor microenvironment. The mechanisms by which tumors achieve the ability to evade immunologic control vary. Understanding these differences is crucial for the improvement and application of new immune-based therapies. Much effort has been placed in developing in silico algorithms to predict tumor immunogenicity and to characterize the microenvironment via high-throughput sequencing and gene expression techniques. Each sequencing source, transcriptomics, and genomics yields a distinct level of data, helping to elucidate the tumor-based immune responses and guiding the fine-tuning of current and upcoming immune-based therapies. In this review, we explore some of the immunological concepts behind the new immunotherapies and the bioinformatic tools to study the immunological aspects of tumors, focusing on neoantigen determination and microenvironment deconvolution. We further discuss the immune-based therapies already in clinical use, those underway for future clinical application, the next steps in immunotherapy, and how the characterization of the tumor immune contexture can impact therapies aiming to promote or unleash immune-based tumor elimination.},

Using eTME, genomics, pathology, and medical record data involving {\textgreater}1,000 patients, we established an inflamed pan-RCC subtype (IS) enriched for regulatory T cells, natural killer cells, TH1 cells, neutrophils, macrophages, B cells, and CD8+ T cells.

The IS subtype correlated with systemic manifestations of inflammation such as thrombocytosis and anemia, which are enigmatic predictors of poor prognosis. Furthermore, IS was a strong predictor of poor survival. Our analyses suggest that tumor cells drive the stromal immune response. These data provide a missing link between tumor cells, the TME, and systemic factors.Significance: We undertook a novel empirical approach to dissect the renal cell carcinoma TME by leveraging tumorgrafts.

	abstract = {Background
Chimeric antigen receptor-engineered T-cell (CAR-T) therapy is a newly developed immunotherapy used in the treatment of cancers. Because CAR-T therapy has shown great success in treating CD19-positive hematological malignancies, its application has been explored in the treatment of solid tumors, such as liver cancer. In this review, we discuss the immune characteristics of liver cancer, the obstacles encountered during the application of CAR-T therapy, and preclinical and clinical progress in the use of CAR-T therapy in patients with liver cancer.
Data sources
The data on CAR-T therapy related to liver cancers were collected by searching PubMed and the Web of Science databases prior to December 2017 with the keywords “chimeric antigen receptor”, “CAR-T”, “liver cancer”, “hepatocellular carcinoma”, and “solid tumor”. Additional articles were identified by manual search of references found in the primary articles. The data for clinical trials were collected by searching ClinicalTrials.gov.
Results
The liver has a tolerogenic nature in the intrahepatic milieu and its tumor microenvironment significantly affects tumor progression. The obstacles that reduce the efficacy of CAR-T therapy in solid tumors include a lack of specific tumor antigens, limited trafficking and penetration of CAR-T cells to tumor sites, and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. To overcome these obstacles, several strategies have emerged. In addition, several strategies have been developed to manage the side effects of CAR-T, including enhancing the selectivity of CARs and controlling CAR-T activity. To date, no clinical trials of CAR-T therapy against HCC have been completed. However, preclinical studies in vitro and in vivo have shown potent antitumor efficacy. Glypican-3, mucin-1, epithelial cell adhesion molecule, carcinoembryonic antigen, and other targets are currently being studied.
Conclusions
The application of CAR-T therapy for liver cancer is just beginning to be explored and more research is needed. However, we are optimistic that CAR-T therapy will offer a new approach for the treatment of liver cancers in the future.},

Sorafenib was the only approved agent for advanced HCC since 2007 until recent breakthroughs. In this article, we will review the newer approved and promising agents in the treatment of advanced HCC in the first line setting and beyond progression.
Main body: The Food and Drug Administration approved sorafenib as it demonstrated 3 months overall survival benefit compared to placebo in the first line setting over 10 years ago. Multiple single agent and combination therapies have been studied but failed to show benefit. Chemotherapy has limited role in patients with advanced HCC given poor hepatic reserve due to underlying cirrhosis. A new era of treatment for advanced HCC arrived recently with exciting data presented for lenvatinib, regorafenib, cabozantinib, nivolumab, ramucirumab and several other promising clinical trials.
Conclusion: Advanced HCC patients are difficult to treat with poor outcomes. After initial approval of sorafenib in 2007, we recently have multiple new agents that showed benefit and promising activity, and are set to change the landscape of HCC treatment.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: During lengthy magnetic resonance-guided high intensity focused ultrasound (MRg-HIFU) thermal ablations in abdominal organs, the therapeutic work-flow is frequently hampered by various types of physiological motion occurring at different time-scales. If left un-addressed this can lead to an incomplete therapy and/or to tissue damage of organs-at-risk. While previous studies focus on correction schemes for displacements occurring at a particular time-scale within the work-flow of an MRg-HIFU therapy, in the current work we propose a motion correction strategy encompassing the entire work-flow.
METHODS: The proposed motion compensation framework consists of several linked components, each being adapted to motion occurring at a particular time-scale. While respiration was addressed through a fast correction scheme, long term organ drifts were compensated using a strategy operating on time-scales of several minutes. The framework relies on a periodic examination of the treated area via MR scans which are then registered to a reference scan acquired at the beginning of the therapy. The resulting displacements were used for both on-the-fly re-optimization of the interventional plan and to ensure the spatial fidelity between the different steps of the therapeutic work-flow. The approach was validated in three complementary studies: an experiment conducted on a phantom undergoing a known motion pattern, a study performed on the abdomen of 10 healthy volunteers and during 3 in-vivo MRg-HIFU ablations on porcine liver.
RESULTS: Results have shown that, during lengthy MRg-HIFU thermal therapies, the human liver and kidney can manifest displacements that exceed acceptable therapeutic margins. Also, it was demonstrated that the proposed framework is capable of providing motion estimates with sub-voxel precision and accuracy. Finally, the 3 successful animal studies demonstrate the compatibility of the proposed approach with the work-flow of an MRg-HIFU intervention under clinical conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: In the current study we proposed an image-based motion compensation framework dedicated to MRg-HIFU thermal ablations in the abdomen, providing the possibility to re-optimize the therapy plan on-the-fly with the patient on the interventional table. Moreover, we have demonstrated that even under clinical conditions, the proposed approach is fully capable of continuously ensuring the spatial fidelity between the different phases of the therapeutic work-flow.},

	abstract = {Kelvin-Voigt fractional derivative (KVFD) model parameters have been used to describe viscoelastic properties of soft tissues. However, translating model parameters into a concise set of intrinsic mechanical properties related to tissue composition and structure remains challenging. This paper begins by exploring these relationships using a biphasic emulsion materials with known composition. Mechanical properties are measured by analyzing data from two indentation techniques - ramp-stress relaxation and load-unload hysteresis tests. Material composition is predictably correlated with viscoelastic model parameters. Model parameters estimated from the tests reveal that elastic modulus E0 closely approximates the shear modulus for pure gelatin. Fractional-order parameter α and time constant τ vary monotonically with the volume fraction of the material's fluid component. α characterizes medium fluidity and the rate of energy dissipation, and τ is a viscous time constant. Numerical simulations suggest that the viscous coefficient η is proportional to the energy lost during quasi-static force-displacement cycles, EA . The slope of EA versus η is determined by α and the applied indentation ramp time Tr. Experimental measurements from phantom and ex vivo liver data show close agreement with theoretical predictions of the η - EA relation. The relative error is less than 20\% for emulsions 22\% for liver. We find that KVFD model parameters form a concise features space for biphasic medium characterization that described time-varying mechanical properties.},

Currently, however, this technique is suitable mainly for tumors less than 4-5 cm in diameter and also results in incomplete ablation at tumor margins ( 2 ). To solve these problems, efforts have been made to combine thermal ablation with other treatment options, such as systemic and intra-arterial administration of therapeutics ( 3 - 5 ). In this issue of Radiology, White et al ( 6 ) introduced their work on development of an alternative approach by using biofunctionalized hybrid magnetic gold nanoparticles (HNPs) as catalysts for photothermal ablation of CRLM. They found that (a) the targeted (anti-MG1) HNPs are noncytotoxic and have greater than 20\% intratumoral accumulation and (b) systemic administration of anti-MG1 HNPs can enlarge a tumor's necrotic zone with photothermal ablation. The results of this study establish the proof of the concept that targeted HNPs can enhance the therapeutic effect of photothermal ablation, which presents an exciting strategy for complete removal of CRLM by integrating two rapidly advancing scientific fields-interventional radiology and nanotechnology.},

However, the insufficient efficiency of PTT at irradiation levels tolerable to tissues and the limited biodegradability of nanomaterials are still crucial challenges. In this study, a novel nanosystem for PTT based on liposome-nanoparticle assemblies (LNAs) was established.
Materials and methods: Thermal-sensitive liposomes (TSLs) encapsulating cantharidin (CTD) were coated with gold nanoparticles (GNPs) and used in near-infrared (NIR) illumination-triggered PTT and thermally induced disruption on A431 cells.
Results: The coated GNPs disintegrated into small particles of 5-6 nm after disruption of TSLs, allowing their clearance by the liver and kidneys. CTD encapsulated in the TSLs was released into cytoplasm after PTT. The released CTD increased the apoptosis of PTT-treated tumor cells by blocking the heat shock response (HSR) and inhibiting the expression of HSP70 and BAG3 inhibiting the expression of HSP70 and BAG3 with the synergistic enhancement of CTD, the new nanosystem CTD-encapsulated TSLs coated with GNPs (CTD-TSL@GNPs) had an efficient PTT effect using clinically acceptable irradiation power (200 mW//cm2) on A431 cells.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To retrospectively analyse the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) versus microwave ablation (MWA) in the treatment of unresectable colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) in proximity to large vessels and/or major bile ducts.
METHOD AND MATERIALS: A database search was performed to include patients with unresectable histologically proven and/or (18)F-FDG-PET avid CRLM who were treated with RFA or MWA between January 2001 and September 2014 in a single centre. All lesions that were considered to have a peribiliary and/or perivascular location were included. Univariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the distribution of patient, tumour and procedure characteristics. Multivariate logistic regression was used to correct for potential confounders.
RESULTS: Two hundred and forty-three patients with 774 unresectable CRLM were ablated. One hundred and twenty-two patients (78 males; 44 females) had at least one perivascular or peribiliary lesion (n = 199). Primary efficacy rate of RFA was superior to MWA after 3 and 12 months of follow-up (P = 0.010 and P = 0.022); however, after multivariate analysis this difference was non-significant at 12 months (P = 0.078) and vanished after repeat ablations (P = 0.39). More CTCAE grade III complications occurred after MWA versus RFA (18.8 vs. 7.9 \%; P = 0.094); biliary complications were especially common after peribiliary MWA (P = 0.002).
CONCLUSION: For perivascular CRLM, RFA and MWA are both safe treatment options that appear equally effective. For peribiliary CRLM, MWA has a higher complication rate than RFA, with similar efficacy. Based on these results, it is advised to use RFA for lesions in the proximity of major bile ducts.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0184810},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Our aim was to develop a new experimental model for in vivo hyperthermia using non-directional microwaves, applicable to small experimental animals. We present an affordable approach for targeted microwave heat delivery to an isolated liver lobe in rat, which allows rapid, precise and stable tissue temperature control.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A new experimental model is proposed. We used a commercial available magnetron generating 2450 MHz, with 4.4V and 14A in the filament and 4500V anodic voltage. Modifications were required in order to adjust tissue heating such as to prevent overheating and to allow for fine adjustments according to real-time target temperature. The heating is controlled using a virtual instrument application implemented in LabView® and responds to 0.1° C variations in the target. Ten healthy adult male Wistar rats, weighing 250-270 g were used in this study. The middle liver lobe was the target for controlled heating, while the rest of the living animal was protected.
RESULTS: In vivo microwave delivery using our experimental setting is safe for the animals. Target tissue temperature rises from 30°C to 40°C with 3.375°C / second (R2 = 0.9551), while the increment is lower it the next two intervals (40-42°C and 42-44°C) with 0.291°C/ s (R2 = 0.9337) and 0.136°C/ s (R2 = 0.7894) respectively, when testing in sequences. After reaching the desired temperature, controlled microwave delivery insures a very stable temperature during the experiments.
CONCLUSIONS: We have developed an inexpensive and easy to manufacture system for targeted hyperthermia using non-directional microwave radiation. This system allows for fine and stable temperature adjustments within the target tissue and is ideal for experimental models testing below or above threshold hyperthermia.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Contrast-enhanced MR images are widely used to confirm the adequacy of ablation margin after liver ablation for early prediction of local recurrence. However, quantitative assessment of the ablation margin by comparing pre- and post-procedural images remains challenging. We developed and tested a novel method for three-dimensional quantitative assessment of ablation margin based on non-rigid image registration and 3D distance map.
METHODS: Our method was tested with pre- and post-procedural MR images acquired in 21 patients who underwent image-guided percutaneous liver ablation. The two images were co-registered using non-rigid intensity-based registration. After the tumor and ablation volumes were segmented, target volume coverage, percent of tumor coverage, and Dice similarity coefficient were calculated as metrics representing overall adequacy of ablation. In addition, 3D distance map around the tumor was computed and superimposed on the ablation volume to identify the area with insufficient margins. For patients with local recurrences, the follow-up images were registered to the post-procedural image. Three-dimensional minimum distance between the recurrence and the areas with insufficient margins was quantified.
RESULTS: The percent tumor coverage for all nonrecurrent cases was 100 \%. Five cases had tumor recurrences, and the 3D distance map revealed insufficient tumor coverage or a 0-mm margin. It also showed that two recurrences were remote to the insufficient margin.
CONCLUSIONS: Non-rigid registration and 3D distance map allow us to quantitatively evaluate the adequacy of the ablation margin after percutaneous liver ablation. The method may be useful to predict local recurrences immediately following ablation procedure.},

The advantages of treatment under endoscopic control are the real-time imaging guidance and the possibility to reach a deep target like the pancreas. Currently, radiofrequency probes specifically designed for ERCP or EUS ablation are available as well as hybrid cryotherm probe combining radiofrequency with cryotechnology. To date, many reports and case series have confirmed the safety and feasibility of that kind of ablation technique in the pancreatic setting. Moreover, EUS-guided fine-needle injection is emerging as a method to deliver ablative and anti-tumoral agents inside the tumuor. Ethanol injection has been proposed mostly for the treatment of PCLs and for symptomatic functioning PNETs, and the use of gemcitabine and paclitaxel is also interesting in this setting. EUS-guided injection of chemical or biological agents including mixed lymphocyte culture, oncolytic viruses, and immature dendritic cells has been investigated for the treatment of LAPC.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled 79 patients in this study, and microwave ablation was used for liver resection. Patients were randomized to group A (50.6\%; n = 40), liver resection without microwave ablation, or group B (49.4\%; n = 39), liver resection performed using microwave ablation. Data were analyzed for statistical significance.
RESULTS: Of the participants enrolled, 60 were male, and the participant's average age was 59.32 ± 10.34 years. The mean overall tumor diameter was 4.39 (2.00) cm, and this did not differ between groups. Intraoperative blood loss in group B was significantly less than that in group A ( P {\textless} .001). No differences were reported between the 2 groups regarding surgical time ( P = .914), postoperative morbidity ( P = .718), and late postoperative complications ( P = .409). Postoperative drainage volume for group B was less than that of group A on the first ( P = .005) and third ( P = .019) day after surgery. The time of postoperative hospitalization in group B was significantly shorter than that in group A ( P {\textless} .001). Local recurrence was noted in 18.99\% of cases (n = 15) in group B, which is less than that of group A ( P = 0.047), while in group B distant metastasis is less but not statistically significant ( P = 0.061). The 1-year and 3-year cumulative survival rates were 57\% and 93.7\%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The curative effects of liver resection combined with microwave ablation during operation are superior to only liver resection in the treatment of primary liver cancer.},

Although the working mechanism is non-thermal, development of secondary Joule heating occurs. This study investigated whether the observed conductivity rise during IRE is caused by increased cellular permeabilization or heat development.
METHODS: IRE was performed in a gelatin tissue phantom, in potato tubers, and in 30 patients with unresectable colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). Continuous versus sequential pulsing protocols (10-90 vs. 10-30-30-30) were assessed. Temperature was measured using fiber-optic probes. After temperature had returned to baseline, 100 additional pulses were delivered. The primary technique efficacy of the treated CRLM was compared to the periprocedural current rise. Seven patients received ten additional pulses after a 10-min cool-down period.
RESULTS: Temperature and current rise was higher for the continuous pulsing protocol (medians, gel: 13.05 vs. 9.55 °C and 9 amperes (A) vs. 7A; potato: 12.70 vs. 10.53 °C and 6.0A vs. 6.5A). After cooling-down, current returned to baseline in the gel phantom and near baseline values (Δ2A with continuous- and Δ5A with sequential pulsing) in the potato tubers. The current declined after cooling-down in all seven patients with CRLM, although baseline values were not reached. There was a positive correlation between current rise and primary technique efficacy (p = 0.02); however, the previously reported current increase threshold of 12-15A was reached in 13\%.
CONCLUSION: The observed conductivity rise during IRE is caused by both cellular permeabilization and heat development. Although a correlation between current rise and efficacy exists, the current increase threshold seems unfeasible for CRLM.},

This cesium-based block co-polymer compound transforms from a liquid to a gel at body temperature and is intrinsically visible by computed tomography. Using an agarose phantom model, herein we demonstrate that both the rate and magnitude of temperature increase during microwave ablation were significantly greater in the presence of TA when compared with controls. These results suggest robust augmentation of microwave energy, and may translate into larger ablation zone volumes within biologic tissues.

	abstract = {Primary liver cancer-including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC)-incidence is increasing and is an important source of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Management of these cancers, even when localized, is challenging due to the association with underlying liver disease and the complex anatomy of the liver. Although for ICC, surgical resection provides the only potential cure, for HCC, the risks and benefits of the multiple curative intent options must be considered to individualize treatment based upon tumor factors, baseline liver function, and the functional status of the patient. The principles of surgical resection for both HCC and ICC include margin-negative resections with preservation of adequate function of the residual liver. As the safety of surgical resection has improved in recent years, the role of liver resection for HCC has expanded to include selected patients with preserved liver function and small tumors (ablation as an alternative), tumors within Milan criteria (transplant as an alternative), and patients with large ({\textgreater}5 cm) and giant ({\textgreater}10 cm) HCC or with poor prognostic features (for whom surgery is infrequently offered) due to a survival benefit with resection for selected patients. An important surgical consideration specifically for ICC includes the high risk of nodal metastasis, for which portal lymphadenectomy is recommended at the time of hepatectomy for staging. For both diseases, onco-surgical strategies including portal vein embolization and parenchymal-sparing resections have increased the number of patients eligible for curative liver resection by improving patient outcomes. Multidisciplinary evaluation is critical in the management of patients with primary liver cancer to provide and coordinate the best treatments possible for these patients.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: This work describes the characterization and evaluation of a tissue-mimicking thermochromic phantom (TMTCP) for direct visualization and quantitative determination of temperatures during radiofrequency ablation (RFA).
METHODS: TMTCP material was prepared using polyacrylamide gel and thermochromic ink that permanently changes color from white to magenta when heated. Color vs temperature calibration was generated in matlab by extracting RGB color values from digital photographs of phantom standards heated in a water bath at 25-75 °C. RGB and temperature values were plotted prior to curve fitting in mathematica using logistic functions of form f(t) = a + b/(1 + e((c(t-d)))), where a, b, c, and d are coefficients and t denotes temperature. To quantify temperatures based on TMTCP color, phantom samples were heated to temperatures blinded to the investigators, and two methods were evaluated: (1) visual comparison of sample color to the calibration series and (2) in silico analysis using the inverse of the logistic functions to convert sample photograph RGB values to absolute temperatures. For evaluation of TMTCP performance with RFA, temperatures in phantom samples and in a bovine liver were measured radially from an RF electrode during heating using fiber-optic temperature probes. Heating and cooling rates as well as the area under the temperature vs time curves were compared. Finally, temperature isotherms were generated computationally based on color change in bisected phantoms following RFA and compared to temperature probe measurements.
RESULTS: TMTCP heating resulted in incremental, permanent color changes between 40 and 64 °C. Visual and computational temperature estimation methods were accurate to within 1.4 and 1.9 °C between 48 and 67 °C, respectively. Temperature estimates were most accurate between 52 and 62 °C, resulting in differences from actual temperatures of 0.6 and 1.6 °C for visual and computational methods, respectively. Temperature measurements during RFA using fiber-optic probes matched closely with maximum temperatures predicted by color changes in the TMTCP. Heating rate and cooling rate, as well as the area under the temperature vs time curve were similar for TMTCP and ex vivo liver.
CONCLUSIONS: The TMTCP formulated for use with RFA can be used to provide quantitative temperature information in mild hyperthermic (40-45 °C), subablative (45-50 °C), and ablative ({\textgreater}50 °C) temperature ranges. Accurate visual or computational estimates of absolute temperatures and ablation zone geometry can be made with high spatial resolution based on TMTCP color. As such, the TMTCP can be used to assess RFA heating characteristics in a controlled, predictable environment.},

Effects of PEGylation on the size and surface potential of nanocomplexes were analyzed. Nanospheres containing uniformly dispersed SPIO was observed using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) imaging. As a potential magnetic resonance (MR) imaging agent, the HISP displayed dose-dependent T2-weighted imaging contrast (R2 = 81.6 mM-1s-1). Good colloidal stability was verified from the nanocomplexes under difference circumstances. The nanocomplexes were taken up by cancer cells efficiently and led to significant photothermal-mediated cancer cell death upon short-term near infrared (NIR) irradiation in vitro. Via intravenous injection, PEG-HISP can efficiently deliver IR780 to tumor sites and showed strong photothermal effect compared to free drug on the mice model. Significant tumor suppression by the photothermal treatments using PEG-HISP was demonstrated from the mice CT26 xenograft model. Good safety profile of the PEG-HISP was confirmed from histological examination and liver functional analysis.

This treatment is noted for its great effectiveness, minimal invasiveness and local effect. Several studies have been conducted worldwide to evaluate the antitumoral effect of this therapy. In all these studies a variety of biochemical and physiological responses of tumors to the applied treatment have been obtained. By this reason, researchers have suggested various mechanisms to explain how direct electric current destroys tumor cells. Although, it is generally accepted this treatment induces electrolysis, electroosmosis and electroporation in tumoral tissues. However, action mechanism of this alternative modality on the tumor tissue is not well understood. Although the principle of Electrochemical treatment is simple, a standardized method is not yet available. The mechanism by which Electrochemical treatment affects tumor growth and survival may represent more complex process. The present work analyzes the latest and most important research done on the electrochemical treatment of tumors. We conclude with our point of view about the destruction mechanism features of this alternative therapy. Also, we suggest some mechanisms and strategies from the thermodynamic point of view for this therapy. In the area of Electrochemical treatment of cancer this tool has been exploited very little and much work remains to be done.

Materials and Methods This institutional review board approved, HIPAA-compliant retrospective review included 95 patients (75 men and 20 women) with 124 primary HCCs who were treated at a single center between January 2011 and March 2014. Complete occlusion of the portal veins, hepatic veins, and hepatic arteries within and directly abutting the ablation zone was identified with postprocedure contrast material-enhanced computed tomography. For each vessel identified in the ablation zone, its size and antenna spacing were recorded and correlated with vascular occlusion with logistic regression analysis. Local tumor progression rates were then compared between patent and occluded vessels for each vessel type with Fisher exact test. Results Occlusion was identified in 39.7\% of portal veins (29 of 73), 15.0\% of hepatic veins (six of 40), and 14.2\% of hepatic arteries (10 of 70) encompassed within the ablation zone. Hepatic vein occlusion was significantly correlated with a smaller vessel size (P = .036) and vessel-antenna spacing (P = .006). Portal vein occlusion was only significantly correlated with a smaller vessel size (P = .001), particularly in vessels that were less than 3 mm in diameter. Local tumor progression rates were significantly correlated with patent hepatic arteries within the ablation zone (P = .02) but not with patent hepatic (P = .57) or portal (P = .14) veins. Conclusion During microwave ablation of HCC, hepatic veins and arteries were resistant to vessel occlusion compared with portal veins, and only arterial patency within an ablation zone was related to local tumor progression. © RSNA, 2016.},

	abstract = {Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is widely accepted as a first-line interventional oncology approach for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and has the advantages of high treatment efficacy and low complication risk. Local control rates equivalent to hepatic resection can be reached by RFA alone when treating small HCCs ({\textless}2 cm) in favorable locations. However, local tumor progression and recurrence rates with RFA monotherapy increase sharply when treating larger lesions ({\textgreater}3 cm). To address this clinical problem, recent efforts have focused on multimodel management of HCC by combining RFA with different techniques, including percutaneous ethanol injection, transarterial chemo-embolization, targeted molecular therapy, nanoparticle-mediated therapy, and immunotherapy. The combination strategy indeed leads to better outcomes in comparison to RFA alone. In this article, we review the current status of RFA-combined multimodal therapies in the management of HCC.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine if outpatient medications taken at the time of liver tumor embolization or ablation affect survival.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was done of 2,032 liver tumor embolization, radioembolization, and ablation procedures performed in 1,092 patients from June 2009 to April 2016. Pathology, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) stage (American Joint Committee on Cancer), neuroendocrine tumor (NET) grade, initial locoregional therapy, overall survival after initial locoregional therapy, Child-Pugh score, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and outpatient medications taken at the time of locoregional therapy were analyzed for each patient. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were calculated for patients taking 29 medications or medication classes (including prescription and nonprescription medications) for reasons unrelated to their primary cancer diagnosis. Kaplan-Meier curves were compared using the log-rank test.
RESULTS: For patients with HCC initially treated with embolization (n = 304 patients), the following medications were associated with improved survival when taken at the time of embolization: beta-blockers (P = .0007), aspirin (P = .0008) and other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (P = .009), proton pump inhibitors (P = .004), and antivirals for hepatitis B or C (P = .01). For colorectal liver metastases initially treated with ablation (n = 172 patients), beta-blockers were associated with improved survival when taken at the time of ablation (P = .02).
CONCLUSIONS: Aspirin and beta-blockers are associated with significantly improved survival when taken at the time of embolization for HCC. Aspirin was not associated with survival differences after locoregional therapy for NET or colorectal liver metastases, suggesting an HCC-specific effect.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To create and validate a planning tool for multiple-probe cryoablation, using simulations of ice ball size and shape for various ablation probe configurations, ablation times, and types of tissue ablated.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ice ball size and shape was simulated using the Pennes bioheat equation. Five thousand six hundred and seventy different cryoablation procedures were simulated, using 1-6 cryoablation probes and 1-2 cm spacing between probes. The resulting ice ball was measured along three perpendicular axes and recorded in a database. Simulated ice ball sizes were compared to gel experiments (26 measurements) and clinical cryoablation cases (42 measurements). The clinical cryoablation measurements were obtained from a HIPAA-compliant retrospective review of kidney and liver cryoablation procedures between January 2015 and February 2016. Finally, we created a web-based cryoablation planning tool, which uses the cryoablation simulation database to look up the probe spacing and ablation time that produces the desired ice ball shape and dimensions.
RESULTS: Average absolute error between the simulated and experimentally measured ice balls was 1 mm in gel experiments and 4 mm in clinical cryoablation cases. The simulations accurately predicted the degree of synergy in multiple-probe ablations. The cryoablation simulation database covers a wide range of ice ball sizes and shapes up to 9.8 cm.
CONCLUSION: Cryoablation simulations accurately predict the ice ball size in multiple-probe ablations. The cryoablation database can be used to plan ablation procedures: given the desired ice ball size and shape, it will find the number and type of probes, probe configuration and spacing, and ablation time required.},

Expression of CD8A and VEGFA was confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis with tissue microarrays, and overall survival (OS) was analyzed.Expression profiling data demonstrated that CRC immune microenvironment from right side tumor was characterized as increased infiltration of immune cells with enhanced cytotoxic function, based on higher cytotoxic activity scores (CYT) and interferon-γ signatures. Expression of VEGFA, which could be neutralized by bevacizumab, was associated with decreased levels of activated CD8+ T-cells, Th1 cells, and PRF1 expression on the right side, but not on the left side. IHC analysis of tissue microarrays further confirmed an inverse correlation between CD8A and VEGFA expression, and revealed a favorable OS for patients with CD8AHiVEGFALo disease among right-side CRCs. For the left side, higher CD56bright NK cell infiltration and active 4-1BB/IFN-ɑ signaling, which could providing a favorable condition for cetuximab mediated antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) effect, was present in a cohort with extended OS.In the tumor microenvironment, features of immune phenotype sidedness were identified, providing an implication for differential responses to bevacizumab/cetuximab treatment. Additionally, a new avenue for innovative experimental design and combinational immunotherapy to treat CRC patients was suggested.},

The therapeutic appeal of these treatments is far reaching, and many new applications continue to evolve. In particular, immune modulating drugs have the potential to enhance the systemic anticancer immune effects induced by locoregional thermal ablation. The immune responses induced by ablation monotherapy are well documented, but independently they tend to be incapable of evoking a robust antitumor response. By adding immunomodulators to traditional ablative techniques, several researchers have sought to amplify the induced immune response and trigger systemic antitumor activity. This paper summarizes the work done in animal models to investigate the immune effects induced by the combination of ablative therapy and immunomodulation. Combination therapy with radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation, and microwave ablation are all reviewed, and special attention has been paid to the addition of checkpoint blockades.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development after radiofrequency (RF) ablation, partial surgical hepatectomy, and a sham operation and to inhibit HCC recurrence after RF ablation in a mouse model of spontaneously forming HCC in the setting of chronic inflammation (ie, the MDR2 knockout model).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Animal experiments were performed according to an approved animal care committee protocol. The authors compared the survival of MDR2 knockout mice (an inflammation-induced HCC model) that underwent RF ablation, 35\% partial hepatectomy (ie, left lobectomy), or a sham operation (controls) by using Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis. Tumor load and tumor frequency in mice that underwent sham operation were further compared with those of mice treated with RF ablation at 1 month after therapy by using a two-tailed Student t test. Liver slices from mice treated with RF ablation were stained for α-smooth muscle actin and Ki-67 to establish the role of liver regeneration in the tumorigenic effect of RF ablation. Finally, tumor load and tumor incidence were evaluated in mice treated with a c-met inhibitor after RF ablation by using the Mann-Whitney U test.
RESULTS: Ablation of 3.5\% ± 0.02 of the MDR2 knockout mice liver induced increased tumor load (P = .007) and reduced survival (P = .03) in comparison to that of controls, with no significant difference to the 10-fold volume removal of partial hepatectomy. Seven days after RF treatment, the border zone of the coagulation zone was surrounded by α-smooth muscle actin-positive activated myofibroblasts. A significant elevation of hepatocyte proliferation was also seen 7 days after RF ablation in the distant liver (ablated lobe: P = .003; untreated lobe: P = .02). A c-met inhibitor significantly attenuated HCC development in MDR2 knockout mice treated with RF ablation (P = .001).
CONCLUSION: Liver regeneration induced by RF ablation facilitates c-met/hepatocyte growth factor axis-dependent HCC tumor formation after treatment in the MDR2 knockout model. Blockage of the c-met/hepatocyte growth factor axis attenuates HCC recurrence, raising the potential for therapeutic intervention to reverse this potentially deleterious tumorigenic effect.},

	abstract = {PurposeTo determine the kinetics of innate immune and hepatic response to the coagulation necrosis area that remains in situ after radiofrequency (RF) ablation, the cytokine profile of this response, and its local and global effect on the whole organ in a small-animal model.Materials and MethodsA standardized RF ablation dose (70°C for 5 minutes) was used to ablate more than 7\% of the liver in 91 C57BL6 mice (wild type) according to a protocol approved by the animal care committee. The dynamic cellular response in the border zone surrounding ablation-induced coagulation and in the ablated lobe and an untreated lobe were characterized with immunohistochemistry 24 hours, 72 hours, 7 days, and 14 days after ablation (the time points at which cells migrate to necrotic tissues). After characterization of the cellular populations that reacted to the RF treatment, cytokines secreted by these cells were blocked, either by using interleukin-6 knockout mice (n = 24) or c-met inhibitor PHA 665752 (n = 15), to elucidate the key factors facilitating the wound healing response to RF ablation. Statistical significance was assessed with nonparametric analysis of variance.ResultsRF ablation induces a strong time-dependent immunologic response at the perimeter of the necrotic zone. This includes massive accumulation of neutrophils, activated myofibroblasts, and macrophages peaking at 24 hours, 7 days, and 14 days after ablation, respectively. In correlation with myofibroblast accumulation, RF ablation induced hepatocyte proliferation in both the ablated lobe and an untreated lobe (mean, 165.15 and 230.4 cyclin-dependent kinase 47–positive cells per ×20 field, respectively, at day 7; P {\textless} .02). Blockade of either IL-6 or c-met significantly reduced global hepatocyte proliferation (P {\textless} .05 for both), with the former reducing the accumulation of both macrophages and myofibroblasts surrounding the coagulation necrosis area (42.9 and 113.6 vs 7.3 and 46.6 macrophages and activated myofibroblasts per ×20 field, respectively; P {\textless} .036 for both).ConclusionHepatic RF ablation induces not only a local periablational inflammatory zone but also more global proliferative effects on the liver. These IL-6– and/or c-met–mediated changes could potentially account for some of the local and distant tumor recurrence observed after treatment.© RSNA, 2015Online supplemental material is available for this article.},

Inflammation is a key contributor to short- and long-term cancer eradication, with significant tumour and normal tissue consequences. Therefore, the role of radiation in modulating the inflammatory response is highly topical given the current wave of targeted and immuno-therapeutic treatments for cancer.

	abstract = {Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an important treatment option for patients with early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). RFA offers a reliable, reproducible modality to effectively treat hepatic lesions with minimal collateral damage to the surrounding hepatic parenchyma. In addition to traditional open operative techniques, RFA can be performed percutaneously or laparoscopically to minimize the physiologic insult to the patient. Due to the concomitant hepatic damage and dysfunction that often is present in patients with HCC these factors make RFA a frequently utilized therapeutic option. However, RFA is most efficacious in treating smaller tumors (≤ 2 cm), particularly when an ablation margin of ≥ 4–5 mm can be obtained. RFA has diminishing utility in larger tumors, resulting in reduced three and five year overall survival rates when compared to surgical resection. Multimodal approaches to include RFA with other standard and investigational approaches have become a subject of recent interest. RFA capably produces cellular destruction causing liberation of a substantial amount of antigens, many of which are tumor-specific providing a favorable environment for immune recognition. We propose that utilizing an immunotherapeutic approach in conjunction with RFA is the next logical step in the treatment of HCC. In this review, we summarize how RFA modulates antitumor immunity and works in concert with immunotherapy in the treatment of HCC. The information provided is expected to help the future design of novel RFA-integrated immunotherapies which are able to generate durable and powerful antitumor immune response to achieve optimal tumor control.},

Important prognosticators for response to immunotherapy are the mutation burden of tumours as well as the quality and quantity of tumour-infiltrating immune cells. High-throughput multiplex immunophenotyping technologies have a central role in deciphering the complexity of anti-tumour immune responses. Current techniques for the immunophenotyping of solid tumours are held back by the lack of spatial context, limitations in the number of targets that can be visualised simultaneously, and/or cumbersome protocols. We developed a tyramide signal amplification (TSA) – free method for the simultaneous detection of 7 cellular targets by immunofluorescence. This method overcomes limitations posed by most widespread techniques and provides a unique tool for extensive phenotyping by multispectral fluorescence microscopy. Furthermore, it can be easily implemented as a high-throughput technology for validation of discovery sets generated by RNA sequencing or mass cytometry and may serve in the future as a complementary diagnostic tool.

	abstract = {Purpose Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a minimally invasive energy delivery technique increasingly used for focal therapy to eradicate localized disease. RFA-induced tumor-cell necrosis generates an immunogenic source of tumor antigens known to induce antitumor immune responses. However, RFA-induced antitumor immunity is insufficient to control metastatic progression. We sought to characterize (a) the role of RFA dose on immunogenic modulation of tumor and generation of immune responses and (b) the potential synergy between vaccine immunotherapy and RFA aimed at local tumor control and decreased systemic progression. Experimental Design Murine colon carcinoma cells expressing the tumor-associated (TAA) carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (MC38-CEA+) were studied to examine the effect of sublethal hyperthermia in vitro on the cells’ phenotype and sensitivity to CTL-mediated killing. The effect of RFA dose was investigated in vivo impacting (a) the phenotype and growth of MC38-CEA+ tumors and (b) the induction of tumor-specific immune responses. Finally, the molecular signature was evaluated as well as the potential synergy between RFA and poxviral vaccines expressing CEA and a TRIad of COstimulatory Molecules (CEA/TRICOM). Results In vitro, sublethal hyperthermia of MC38-CEA+ cells (a) increased cell-surface expression of CEA, Fas, and MHC class I molecules and (b) rendered tumor cells more susceptible to CTL-mediated lysis. In vivo, RFA induced (a) immunogenic modulation on the surface of tumor cells and (b) increased T-cell responses to CEA and additional TAAs. Combination therapy with RFA and vaccine in CEA-transgenic mice induced a synergistic increase in CD4+ T-cell immune responses to CEA and eradicated both primary CEA+ and distal CEA– s.c. tumors. Sequential administration of low-dose and high-dose RFA with vaccine decreased tumor recurrence compared to RFA alone. These studies suggest a potential clinical benefit in combining RFA with vaccine in cancer patients, and augment support for this novel translational paradigm.},

	abstract = {Since the 1920s the gold standard for treating cancer has been surgery, which is typically preceded or followed with chemotherapy and radiation, a process that perhaps contributes to the destruction of a patient’s immune defense system. Cryosurgery ablation of a solid tumor is mechanistically similar to a vaccination where hundreds of unique antigens from a heterogeneous population of tumor cells derived from the invading cancer are released. However, releasing tumor-derived self-antigens into circulation may not be sufficient enough to overcome the checkpoint escape mechanisms some cancers have evolved to avoid immune responses. The potentiated immune response caused by blocking tumor checkpoints designed to prevent programmed cell death may be the optimal treatment method for the immune system to recognize these new circulating cryoablated self-antigens. Pre-clinical and clinical evidence exists for the complementary roles for CTLA-4 and PD-1 antagonists in regulating adaptive immunity, demonstrating that combination immunotherapy followed by cryosurgery provides a more targeted immune response to distant lesions, a phenomenon known as the abscopal effect. We propose that when the host’s immune system has been “primed” with combined anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 adjuvants prior to cryosurgery, the preserved cryoablated tumor antigens will be presented and processed by the host’s immune system resulting in a robust cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell response. Based on recent investigations and well-described biochemical mechanisms presented herein, a polyvalent autoinoculation of many tumor-specific antigens, derived from a heterogeneous population of tumor cancer cells, would present to an unhindered yet pre-sensitized immune system yielding a superior advantage in locating, recognizing and destroying tumor cells throughout the body.},

	abstract = {Background
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) accelerate the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) residual after incomplete radiofrequency ablation (In-RFA). The present study aimed to detect the effects of In-RFA on stemness transcription factors (STFs) expression which are important for the production and function of CSCs, and to find which STFs promote HCC stemness after In-RFA.
Methods
HepG2 cells were used for in vitro and in vivo studies. Flow cytometry and sphere-formation assays were used to detect the level and function of CD133+CSCs in the models. PCR array and ELISA were applied to analyze the altered expression of 84 STFs in CD133+CSCs in two models. Specific lentiviral shRNA was used to knockdown STFs expression, followed by detecting In-RFA's effects on the levels and function of CD133+CSCs.
Results
In-RFA was identified to induce CD133+CSCs and increase their tumorigenesis ability in vitro and in vivo. The mRNA levels of 84 STFs in CD133+CSCs were detected by PCR array, showing that 15 and 22 STFs were up-regulated in two models, respectively. Meanwhile, the mRNA levels of seven common STFs were up-regulated in both models. ELISA assay demonstrated that only the protein of sex determining region Y-box 9 (SOX9) was up-regulated in both models, the protein levels of the other 6 common STFs did not increase in both models. Finally, SOX9 was identified to play an important role in inducing, maintaining stemness and promoting tumorigenesis ability of CD133+CSCs in both models.
Conclusion
In-RFA-induced SOX9 stimulates CD133+CSCs proliferation and increases their tumorigenesis ability, suggesting that SOX9 may be a good target for HCC treatment.},

	abstract = {T cell activation is a crucial checkpoint of adaptive immune responses to infections orcancers. Chronic T cell activation and/or changes in the environment of T cellactivation can lead to T cell dysfunction and to an impaired clearance of the pathogen.While the molecular changes occurring following activation are well studied, little isknown about the mechanisms underlying naïve T cell preparedness and the metabolicchanges associated with T cell activation.By using a pulsed SILAC proteomic approach and RNA sequencing, we determinedglobal translational activity and transcript abundances in naïve and activated humanT cells. While the majority of the proteome of naïve T cells was stable, roughly 1 \%of the proteins were rapidly renewed, including receptors and transcription factorsthat shape the identity of CD4+ T cells and promote quiescence. Furthermore, weshowed that despite the low translational activity of naïve T cells, they contain largenumbers of unused ribosomes and TOP-mRNAs. Upon naïve T cell activation, TOPmRNAswere rapidly engaged in an mTORC1-dependent manner. Thus, this studydiscloses different mechanisms supporting naïve T cell preparedness.Secondly, I analysed the metabolic changes associated with naïve T cell activation.To do so, kinetics of the metabolome and proteome following stimulation of naïveT cells were generated. While numerous pathways were up-regulated upon activation,an increased arginine metabolism led to a drop in intracellular L-arginineconcentrations. Elevating intracellular L-arginine levels were associated withprolonged survival capacity and improved anti-tumor response. Structural analysisallowed the identification of three transcriptional regulators (BAZ1B, PSIP1, TSN)that induced L-arginine-mediated prolonged survival. Thus, L-arginine is a keymetabolic regulator in T cells and increased intracellular levels are associated withimproved T cell survival and anti-tumor functionality.Finally, we aimed to establish microfluidics-based grafting of TCRs (MIGOT) toovercome the limitation of initial TIL expansion. By using a microfluidic device, wewere able to transfer TCRs from TILs onto a reporter cell line, which can be analysed Summary 7according to the specificity of the engrafted TCRs. MIGOT offers the possibility tolink information about TCR diversity with specificity. Moreover, MIGOT allows theanalysis of the TCR repertoire of TILs at the highest state of TCR diversity.},

	abstract = {The treatment of cancer by chemotherapy causes tumour cell death, mostly by apoptosis. This tumour cell death may or may not elicit an immune response. At least in some cases, the efficacy of chemotherapy critically depends on the induction of immunogenic cell death that is a type of cell demise that stimulates the activation of an adaptative anti-tumour immune response, which in turn helps to eradicate residual cancer (stem) cells. Indeed, anthracyclins care more efficient in curing tumours in immunocompetent than in T cell-deficient mice. The molecular mechanism implicated in this anti-tumour T cell activation was recently discovered. Anthracyclins cause immunogenic cell death due to their specific capacity to stimulate the translocation of calreticulin to the cell surface. Calreticulin then acts as an "eat me" signal for dendritic cells, allowing them to phagocytose tumour cells and to prime tumour antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells. Importantly, non-immunogenic chemotherapy can be rendered immunogenic by adsorbing recombinant calreticulin to tumour cells or by enforcing the translocation of endogenous calreticulin to the cell surface by means of PP1/GADD34 inhibitors. This strategy could have major implications for the treatment of human cancer. Indeed, in vivo treatments with anthracyclins can cause the translocation of calreticulin to the surface of circulating tumour cells, in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The challenge will be to determine whether the exposure of calreticulin translocation on the tumour cell surface is linked to chemotherapy-induced anti-tumour immune responses and therapeutic efficacy in human cancer.},

ATP released by dying cancer cells recruited myeloid cells into tumors and stimulated the local differentiation of CD11c(+)CD11b(+)Ly6C(hi) cells.

	abstract = {Interactions between the immune system and tumors have been among the highlights of presentimmunological research. An extensive body of new knowledge recently substantiated the long-presumedconcept of cancer immunosurveillance. Immune system searches the organism for cells expressing tumorantigens or cellular stress signals and destroys them. T-cells, NK-cells and dendritic cells, as well as cytokinesignaling and direct cell cytotoxicity play dominant role in this process. However, a fraction of nascenttumors can evade these mechanisms and create a dynamic equilibrium, gradually sculpting its phenotype byclonal selection. Eventually, tumor cells escape immune control by concealing themselves from recognitionor by actively subjugating local immune response. This immunosubversion results in formation ofimmunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by recruiting protumorigenic cell populations, such as Tregcells, macrophages and myeloid derived suppressor cells. Soluble signaling molecules, as well as surfaceexpressedimmune checkpoint molecules are exploited by tumor cells for inhibition of anti-tumor immunity.Highly effective therapeutic antibodies blocking these checkpoints have been developed for clinical use, withmany more in current trials. Several other promising immunotherapeutic approaches (tumor vaccines,adoptive T-cell therapy with chimeric antigenic receptors) have been used or are in clinical trials.},

Potentially, in situ tumor destruction also can provide the immune system with an antigen source for the induction of antitumor immunity. Antigen-presenting cells could take up antigens in the periphery after which they induce specific immune responses. Recent data show that especially antigen-presenting dendritic cells are crucial for the induction of potent immune responses. However, virtually nothing is known regarding the induction of immune responses after in situ tumor destruction in mice or humans. We used the well-defined murine B16-OVA melanoma cell line to develop a novel tumor model to explore: (a). the immunologic consequences of in situ tumor destruction; and (b). the efficacy of a combination approach of tumor destruction and immunostimulation. Applying this model system we demonstrate that following RFA, a weak but detectable immune response develops, directed against OVA, but also against a broader range of B16 antigens. Adoptive transfer experiments further indicate that antitumor reactivity can be transferred to naïve mice by splenocytes. To augment the response observed, we administered a blocking monoclonal antibody against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 at the time of tumor destruction. Interestingly, this strongly enhanced antitumor immunity, resulting in long-lasting tumor protection. These results illustrate that in situ tumor destruction can provide a useful antigen source for the induction of antitumor immunity, provided that additional immunostimulatory signals are coadministered.},

Here, we report that the mTORC1/2 dual kinase inhibitor vistusertib (AZD2014) potentiates anti-tumour immunity in combination with anti-CTLA-4 (αCTLA-4), αPD-1 or αPD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade. Combination of vistusertib and immune checkpoint blocking antibodies led to tumour growth inhibition and improved survival of MC-38 or CT-26 pre-clinical syngeneic tumour models, whereas monotherapies were less effective. Underlying these combinatorial effects, vistusertib/immune checkpoint combinations reduced the occurrence of exhausted phenotype tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), whilst increasing frequencies of activated Th1 polarized T-cells in tumours. Vistusertib alone was shown to promote a Th1 polarizing proinflammatory cytokine profile by innate primary immune cells. Moreover, vistusertib directly enhanced activation of effector T-cell and survival, an effect that was critically dependent on inhibitor dose. Therefore, these data highlight direct, tumour-relevant immune potentiating benefits of mTOR inhibition that complement immune checkpoint blockade.

	abstract = {PD-1- and PD-L1-blocking monoclonal antibodies have shown significant promise in clinical settings and rekindled the hope for successful cancer immunotherapy. We recently demonstrated that interfering with PD-1/PD-L1 signaling selectively augments CD8+ T cell (TCD8) responses to subdominant determinants (SDDs) of a model tumor antigen. This was likely due to decreased lysis of SDD-specific TCD8 by neighboring immunodominant clones co-engaging the same antigen-presenting cells (APCs). We therefore proposed that PD-1-based checkpoint inhibitors widen the range of tumor determinants that can be effectively targeted by TCD8. Subsequently and using different tumor models, Chen et al. reported, in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, that PD-L1 protects APCs from the lytic function of immunodominant TCD8 and that PD-L1 blockade narrows, rather than broadens, the overall anticancer T cell response. Here, we briefly compare and contrast the experimental systems employed by the two groups, which may account, at least partially, for the opposing conclusions drawn. We argue that the pathway(s) of tumor antigen presentation, direct presentation versus cross-presentation, and the intensity of PD-1 expression by immunodominant and subdominant TCD8 must be taken into consideration in rational design of anti-PD-1/PD-L1-adjuvanted tumor vaccines and therapies.},

However, current protein and cell therapy tools used in cancer immunotherapy are far from perfect, and there is room for improvement regarding their efficacy and safety. RNA-based structures have diverse functions, ranging from gene expression and gene regulation to pro-inflammatory effects and the ability to specifically bind different molecules. These functions make them versatile tools that may advance cancer vaccines and immunomodulation, surpassing existing approaches. These technologies should not be considered as competitors of current immunotherapies but as partners in synergistic combinations and as a clear opportunity to reach more efficient and personalized results. RNA and RNA derivatives can be exploited therapeutically as a platform to encode protein sequences, provide innate pro-inflammatory signals to the immune system (such as those denoting viral infection), control the expression of other RNAs (including key immunosuppressive factors) post-transcriptionally and conform structural scaffoldings binding proteins that control immune cells by modifying their function. Nascent RNA immunotherapeutics include RNA vaccines encoding cancer neoantigens, mRNAs encoding immunomodulatory factors, viral RNA analogues, interference RNAs and protein-binding RNA aptamers. These approaches are already in early clinical development with promising safety and efficacy results.},

	abstract = {Figure 1. Main Applications of Mouse Models for Tumor Immunology and Immunotherapy. Immunodeficient mice xenografted with human cancer cell lines have been at the foundation of in vivo cancer research for several decades, providing ground for the regulatory approval of multiple chemotherapeutics and targeted anticancer agents, but are intrinsically unsuitable for studying tumor immunology and immunotherapy. Similarly, patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) established in immunodeficient mice are not subjected to immunosurveillance by the host, although (depending on the protocol employed for PDX generation) some components of the patient’s immune system may also be transferred to the mouse and be active, at least for some time. Considerable efforts are being devoted to the generation of humanized mice to circumvent these limitations. The establishment of PDXs in immunodeficient mice that are also engrafted with matched patient-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is also being investigated as a means to screen for the efficacy of (immuno)therapeutic agents in support of clinical decision making. Mouse cancer cell lines grafted subcutaneously or orthotopically in immunocompetent syngeneic hosts have been instrumental for the development of a variety of immunotherapeutics, as well as for the discovery that conventional anticancer regimens, including some forms of chemotherapy and radiation therapy, can trigger tumor-targeting immune responses. Carcinogen-driven tumors established in immunocompetent versus immunodeficient animals were critical in the early days of modern tumor immunology, as they enabled the discovery of natural anticancer immunosurveillance. Moreover, they allow for investigating the immunological versus non-immunological efficacy of anticancer (immuno)therapeutics in the context of natural immunoediting, clinically relevant immunobiological heterogeneity, and high mutation load. Transgene-driven tumors have generated in-depth insights into the crosstalk between oncogenic drivers and the tumor microenvironment, in both its immunological and non-immunological components. Each of these models is associated with specific advantages and disadvantages (see Key Facts). Figure 2. Key Features of Mouse Models for Tumor Immunology and Immunotherapy. Key parameters that should be taken into careful consideration when choosing the most appropriate mouse model for the study of tumor immunology and immunotherapy include not only the immunological competence of the host (which is influenced by strain, sex, and age) and its immunological compatibility with malignant cells (which is dictated by strain), but also the mutational load of the latter, their immunological history (previous immunoediting), proliferative potential, propensity for neovascularization and metastatic dissemination, as well as their ability to generate an immunostimulatory versus immunosuppressive microenvironment. Inoculation site is also an important parameter to keep under consideration (not shown). The precise objective of each study dictates which specific combination of such features should be preferred.},

	abstract = {CTLA4 is an essential negative regulator of T-cell immune responses and a key checkpoint regulating autoimmunity and antitumor responses. Genetic mutations resulting in quantitative defects in the CTLA4 pathway are also associated with the development of immune dysregulation syndromes in humans. It has been proposed that CTLA4 functions to remove its ligands CD80 and CD86 from opposing cells by a process known as transendocytosis. A quantitative characterization of CTLA4 synthesis, endocytosis, degradation, and recycling and how these affect its function is currently lacking. In a combined in vitro and in silico study, we developed a mathematical model and identified these trafficking parameters. Our model predicts optimal ligand removal in an intermediate affinity range. The intracellular CTLA4 pool as well as fast internalization, recovery of free CTLA4 from internalized complexes, and recycling is critical for sustained functionality. CD80-CTLA4 interactions are predicted to dominate over CD86-CTLA4. Implications of these findings in the context of control of antigen-presenting cells by regulatory T cells and of pathologic genetic deficiencies are discussed. The presented mathematical model can be reused in the community beyond these questions to better understand other trafficking receptors and study the impact of CTLA4 targeting drugs.},

	abstract = {Checkpoint inhibitors and adoptive cell therapy provide promising options for treating solid cancers such as HBV-related HCC, but they have limitations. We tested the potential to combine advantages of each approach, genetically reprogramming T cells specific for viral tumor antigens to overcome exhaustion by down-modulating the co-inhibitory receptor PD-1. We developed a novel lentiviral transduction protocol to achieve preferential targeting of endogenous or TCR-redirected, antigen-specific CD8 T cells for shRNA knockdown of PD-1 and tested functional consequences for antitumor immunity. Antigen-specific and intrahepatic CD8 T cells transduced with lentiviral (LV)-shPD-1 consistently had a marked reduction in PD-1 compared to those transduced with a control lentiviral vector. PD-1 knockdown of human T cells rescued antitumor effector function and promoted killing of hepatoma cells in a 3D microdevice recapitulating the pro-inflammatory PD-L1hi liver microenvironment. However, upon repetitive stimulation, PD-1 knockdown drove T cell senescence and induction of other co-inhibitory pathways. We provide the proof of principle that T cells with endogenous or genetically engineered specificity for HBV-associated HCC viral antigens can be targeted for functional genetic editing. We show that PD-1 knockdown enhances immediate tumor killing but is limited by compensatory engagement of alternative co-inhibitory and senescence program upon repetitive stimulation.},

However, there is limited literature on the influence on cell signaling with short transient high-amplitude pulses typically used in irreversible electroporation (IRE) for cancer treatment. Moreover, literature on signaling pertaining to immune cell trafficking after IRE is conflicting. We hypothesized that pulse parameters (field strength and exposure time) influence cell signaling and subsequently impact immune-cell trafficking. This hypothesis was tested in-vitro on triple negative breast cancer cells treated with IRE, where the effects of pulse parameters on key cell signaling factors were investigated. Importantly, real time PCR mRNA measurements and ELISA protein analyses revealed that thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) signaling was down regulated by electric field strengths above a critical threshold, irrespective of exposure times spanning those typically used clinically. Comparison with other treatments (thermal shock, chemical poration, kinase inhibitors) revealed that IRE has a unique effect on TSLP. Because TSLP signaling has been demonstrated to drive pro-cancerous immune cell phenotypes in breast and pancreatic cancers, our finding motivates further investigation into the potential use of IRE for induction of an anti-tumor immune response in vivo.},

	volume = {19},
	issn = {1476-5608},
	doi = {10.1038/pcan.2016.23},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treatment options for radio-recurrent prostate cancer are either androgen-deprivation therapy or salvage prostatectomy. Whole-gland high-intensity focussed ultrasound (HIFU) might have a role in this setting.
METHODS: An independent HIFU registry collated consecutive cases of HIFU. Between 2005 and 2012, we identified 50 men who underwent whole-gland HIFU following histological confirmation of localised disease following prior external beam radiotherapy (2005-2012). No upper threshold was applied for risk category, PSA or Gleason grade either at presentation or at the time of failure. Progression was defined as a composite with biochemical failure (Phoenix criteria (PSA{\textgreater}nadir+2 ng ml(-1))), start of systemic therapies or metastases.
RESULTS: Median age (interquartile range (IQR)), pretreatment PSA (IQR) and Gleason score (range) were 68 years (64-72), 5.9 ng ml(-1) (2.2-11.3) and 7 (6-9), respectively. Median follow-up was 64 months (49-84). In all, 24/50 (48\%) avoided androgen-deprivation therapies. Also, a total of 28/50 (56\%) achieved a PSA nadir {\textless}0.5 ng ml(-1), 15/50 (30\%) had a nadir ⩾0.5 ng ml(-1) and 7/50 (14\%) did not nadir (PSA non-responders). Actuarial 1, 3 and 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 72, 40 and 31\%, respectively. Actuarial 1, 3 and 5-year overall survival (OS) was 100, 94 and 87\%, respectively. When comparing patients with PSA nadir {\textless}0.5 ng ml(-1), nadir ⩾0.5 and non-responders, a statistically significant difference in PFS was seen (P{\textless}0.0001). Three-year PFS in each group was 57, 20 and 0\%, respectively. Five-year OS was 96, 100 and 38\%, respectively. Early in the learning curve, between 2005 and 2007, 3/50 (6\%) developed a fistula. Intervention for bladder outlet obstruction was needed in 27/50 (54\%). Patient-reported outcome measure questionnaires showed incontinence (any pad-use) as 8/26 (31\%).
CONCLUSIONS: In our series of high-risk patients, in whom 30-50\% may have micro-metastases, disease control rates were promising in PSA responders, however, with significant morbidity. Additionally, post-HIFU PSA nadir appears to be an important predictor for both progression and survival. Further research on focal salvage ablation in order to reduce toxicity while retaining disease control rates is required.},

	abstract = {Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fourth most common and the third most lethal cancer in China. An updated version of consensus-based recommendations on the management of HCC has been recently published by a multidisciplinary group of Chinese experts including liver surgeons, hepatic oncologists, radiologists and pathologists. Major changes have been made to the diagnostic criteria. In addition to dynamic multi-detector computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) are added to the diagnostic imaging tests. Meanwhile, positive alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) no longer functions as a confirmatory test in nodules of 1-2 cm in diameter. For patients with chronic hepatitis B/C or cirrhosis of any cause, nodules more than 2 cm can be diagnosed with HCC based on typical features on one of the four imaging techniques, whereas nodules ≤2 cm need two typical imaging findings for diagnosis. Based on the increased evidences and clinical practices, a new staging system and treatment algorithm has been developed to be more comprehensible and suitable for use in China. Surgical resection, transplantation and local regional therapies (LRTs) are indicated for more progressed HCC in terms of tumor burden and for more diseased patients in terms of liver function in China than in western centers. Laparoscopic liver resections (LLRs) are not restricted by intrahepatic tumor locations and the volume of resected liver, provided lesions generally ≤10 cm. Future efforts involving prospective studies are essential to confirm the validity of the current Chinese guidelines for HCC.},

Systemic chemotherapy has been shown to produce a modest response, but there is no clinically valid biomarker that can be used to predict which patients may benefit. In this case study, we present two patients with metastatic HCC, they received systemic treatment using capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and either bevacizumab or sorafenib. The tumor response to treatment was determined by the progression-free survival (PFS). Molecular profiling of the tumors showed differential expression of biochemical markers and different mutational status of the TP53 and \&beta;-catenin (CTNNB1) genes. We hypothesize that the PFS correlates with the tumor molecular profiles, which may be predictive of the therapeutic response to systemic chemotherapy. Further investigation is indicated to correlate tumor biomarkers and treatment responses, with the objective of personalizing the therapies for patients with advanced HCC.},

	abstract = {With increasing clinical use, radiotherapy (RT) has been considered reliable and effective method for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment, depending on extent of disease and patient characteristics. RT for HCC can improve therapeutic outcomes through excellent local control, downstaging, conversion from unresectable to resectable status, and treatments of unresectable HCCs with vessel invasion or multiple intrahepatic metastases. In addition, further development of modern RT technologies, including image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT), intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), and stereotactic body radiotherapy, has expanded the indication of RT. An essential feature of IGRT is that it allows image guidance therapy through in-room images obtained during radiation delivery. Compared with 3D-conformal RT, distinctions of IMRT are inverse treatment planning process and use of a large number of treatment fields or subfields, which provide high precision and exquisitely conformal dose distribution. These modern RT techniques allow more precise treatment by reducing inter- and intra-fractional errors resulting from daily changes and irradiated dose at surrounding normal tissues. More recently, particle therapy has been actively investigated to improve effectiveness of RT. This review discusses modern RT strategies for HCC, as well as optimal selection of RT in multimodal approach for HCC.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is limited literature about the clinicopathological characteristics and outcomes of rare histologic variants of gallbladder cancer (GBC).
METHODS: Using SEER database, surgically managed GBC patients with microscopically confirmed adenocarcinoma, adenosquamous/squamous cell carcinoma and papillary carcinoma were identified from 1988 to 2009. Patients with second primary cancer and distant metastasis at presentation were excluded. The effect of clinicopathological variables on overall survival (OS) and disease specific survival (DSS) were analyzed using univariate and multivariate proportional hazards modeling. All associations were considered statistically significant at an alpha error of 0.01.
RESULTS: Out of 4738 cases, 217 adenosquamous/squamous (4.6\%), 367 papillary (7.7\%), and 4154 adenocarcinomas (87.7\%) were identified. Median age was 72 years. Higher tumor grade (grade 2, 3, 4 versus grade 1), higher T stage (T2, T3, T4 versus T1), lymph node positivity (N1 versus N0) and adenosquamous/squamous histology (versus adenocarcinoma) had worse OS and DSS (p {\textless} .001). Papillary GBC had better OS and DSS than adenocarcinoma (HR = 0.7; p {\textless} .001). Radical surgery (versus simple cholecystectomy) had better OS (HR = 0.83, p = 0.002) in multivariate analysis. OS rates at 3 and 5 years were 0.56 and 0.44 for papillary, 0.3 and 0.22 for adenocarcinoma, and 0.14 and 0.12 for adenosquamous/squamous histology, while DSS rates at 3 and 5 years were 0.67 and 0.61 for papillary, 0.38 and 0.31 for adenocarcinoma, and 0.17 and 0.16 for adenosquamous/squamous subtypes respectively.
CONCLUSION: Papillary GBC had better survival outcomes while adenosquamous/squamous GBC had worse survival outcomes compared to gallbladder adenocarcinoma.},

In this multicenter study we retrospectively analyzed data from Child-Pugh B-HCC patients naïve to systemic therapies, treated with MC or best supportive care (BSC). To reduce the risk of selection bias, an inverse probability of treatment weighting approach was adopted. Propensity score was generated including: extrahepatic spread; macrovascular invasion; performance status, alphafetoprotein {\textgreater} 400 ng/ml, Child- Pugh score [B7 vs. B8-9]. We identified 35 MC-treated patients and 70 controls. Median overall survival was 7.5 [95\% CI: 3.733-11.267]in MC-patients and 5.1 months [95\% CI: 4.098-6.102] in the BSC group (p = 0.013). In patients treated with MC, median progression-free survival was 4.5 months (95\% CI: 2.5-6.5). The univariate unweighted Cox regression showed a 42\% reduction in death risk for patients on MC (95\%CI: 0.370-0.906; p = 0.017). After weighting for potential confounders, death risk remained essentially unaltered. In the MC group, 12 patients (34.3\%) experienced at least one adverse event, the most common of which were: fatigue (17.1\%), hand-foot syndrome (8.5\%), thrombocytopenia (8.5\%), and neutropenia (5.7\%).

	abstract = {Backgrounds/Aims: Hilar cholangiocarcinomas (HCCAs) are tumors that involve the biliary confluence; at present, radical surgery offers the only chance of long-term survival, but this can be challenging given the complexity of the hilar anatomy. Blumgart and Jarnagin described a preoperative staging system that incorporates the effect of local tumor extent and its impact on adjacent structures and that has been demonstrated to correlate better with actual surgical resectability. The primary aim of this study is to describe the correlation between preoperative Blumgart-Jarnagin staging and its correlation with surgical resectability.
Methods: Patients who underwent surgical resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma at Singapore General Hospital between January 1, 2002, and January 1, 2013, were identified from a prospectively maintained institutional database. All patients were staged based on the criteria described by Blumgart and Jarnagin. Correlation with surgical resectability was then determined.
Results: A total of 19 patients were identified. Overall resectability was 57.8\% (n=11). Patients with Blumgart-Jarnagin stage T1 had the highest rates of resectability at 80\%; patients with stage T2 and T3 disease had resectability rates of 25\% and 40\% respectively. Median overall survival was 13.6 months.
Conclusions: The Blumgart-Jarnagin staging system is useful for predicting tumor resectability in HCCA.},

However, it has not frequently been performed for the liver due to the risk of radiation-induced liver toxicity. Furthermore, liver SBRT is cumbersome because it requires accurate patient repositioning, target localization, control of breathing-related motion, and confers a toxicity risk to the small bowel.

While it can be used as a stand-alone treatment for those patients, it can also be applied either as an alternative or as an adjunct to other HCC therapies (e.g., transarterial chemoembolization, and radiofrequency ablation). SBRT might be an effective and safe bridging therapy for patients awaiting liver transplantation. Furthermore, in recent studies, SBRT has been shown to have a potential role as an immunostimulator, supporting the novel combination strategy of immunoradiotherapy for HCC.

	doi = {10.2478/raon-2014-0022},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Electroporation-based treatments rely on increasing the permeability of the cell membrane by high voltage electric pulses delivered to tissue via electrodes. To ensure that the whole tumor is covered by the sufficiently high electric field, accurate numerical models are built based on individual patient geometry. For the purpose of reconstruction of hepatic vessels from MRI images we searched for an optimal segmentation method that would meet the following initial criteria: identify major hepatic vessels, be robust and work with minimal user input.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We tested the approaches based on vessel enhancement filtering, thresholding, and their combination in local thresholding. The methods were evaluated on a phantom and clinical data.
RESULTS: Results show that thresholding based on variance minimization provides less error than the one based on entropy maximization. Best results were achieved by performing local thresholding of the original de-biased image in the regions of interest which were determined through previous vessel-enhancement filtering. In evaluation on clinical cases the proposed method scored in average sensitivity of 93.68\%, average symmetric surface distance of 0.89 mm and Hausdorff distance of 4.04 mm.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method to segment hepatic vessels from MRI images based on local thresholding meets all the initial criteria set at the beginning of the study and necessary to be used in treatment planning of electroporation-based treatments: it identifies the major vessels, provides results with consistent accuracy and works completely automatically. Whether the achieved accuracy is acceptable or not for treatment planning models remains to be verified through numerical modeling of effects of the segmentation error on the distribution of the electric field.},

Chemoembolization and radioembolization are at the core of the treatment of liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients who cannot receive potentially curative therapies such as transplantation, resection or percutaneous ablation. TACE for liver cancer has been proven to be useful in local tumor control, to prevent tumor progression, prolong patients' life and control patient symptoms. Recent evidence showed in patients with single-nodule HCC of 3 cm or smaller without vascular invasion, the 5-year overall survival (OS) with TACE was similar to that with hepatic resection and radiofrequency ablation. Although being used for decades, Lipiodol(®) (Lipiodol(®) Ultra Fluid(®), Guerbet, France) remains important as a tumor-seeking and radio-opaque drug delivery vector in interventional oncology. There have been efforts to improve the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to tumors. Drug-eluting bead (DEB) is a relatively novel drug delivery embolization system which allows for fixed dosing and the ability to release the anticancer agents in a sustained manner. Three DEBs are available, i.e., Tandem(®) (CeloNova Biosciences Inc., USA), DC-Beads(®) (BTG, UK) and HepaSphere(®) (BioSphere Medical, Inc., USA). Transarterial radioembolization (TARE) technique has been developed, and proven to be efficient and safe in advanced liver cancers and those with vascular complications. Two types of radioembolization microspheres are available i.e., SIR-Spheres(®) (Sirtex Medical Limited, Australia) and TheraSphere(®) (BTG, UK). This review describes the basic procedure of TACE, properties and efficacy of some chemoembolization systems and radioembolization agents which are commercially available and/or currently under clinical evaluation.

The ideal NPs should accumulate in the target site, carry out their function, and then ultimately be eliminated from the body. Here, we show a single-compartment, multifunctional ultrasmall copper sulfide nanodot (CuS ND) that is rapidly cleared from the body. These CuS NDs have a hydrodynamic diameter of {\textless}6 nm, can efficiently absorb near-infrared light for photothermal ablation therapy, and stably incorporate the copper-64 radioisotope for noninvasive positron emission tomography (PET). Importantly, ∼95\% of CuS NDs are excreted intact through the renal-urinary system within 24 h with minimal retention in the liver and the spleen. The ultrasmall CuS NDs accumulate in 4T1 tumors in Balb/c mice, as monitored by PET imaging, and mediate tumor ablation when combined with near-infrared light irradiation. As a first example of PET-visible, renal-clearable inorganic nanomaterials with peak absorption in the near-infrared region, CuS NDs represent a robust platform for cancer imaging and therapy.},

	abstract = {Electroporation-based therapies are powerful biotechnological tools for enhancing the delivery of exogeneous agents or killing tissue with pulsed electric fields (PEFs). Electrochemotherapy (ECT) and gene therapy based on gene electrotransfer (EGT) both use reversible electroporation to deliver chemotherapeutics or plasmid DNA into cells, respectively. In both ECT and EGT, the goal is to permeabilize the cell membrane while maintaining high cell viability in order to facilitate drug or gene transport into the cell cytoplasm and induce a therapeutic response. Irreversible electroporation (IRE) results in cell kill due to exposure to PEFs without drugs and is under clinical evaluation for treating otherwise unresectable tumors. These PEF therapies rely mainly on the electric field distributions and do not require changes in tissue temperature for their effectiveness. However, in immediate vicinity of the electrodes the treatment may results in cell kill due to thermal damage because of the inhomogeneous electric field distribution and high current density during the electroporation-based therapies. Therefore, the main objective of this numerical study is to evaluate the influence of pulse number and electrical conductivity in the predicted cell kill zone due to irreversible electroporation and thermal damage. Specifically, we simulated a typical IRE protocol that employs ninety 100-µs PEFs. Our results confirm that it is possible to achieve predominant cell kill due to electroporation if the PEF parameters are chosen carefully. However, if either the pulse number and/or the tissue conductivity are too high, there is also potential to achieve cell kill due to thermal damage in the immediate vicinity of the electrodes. Therefore, it is critical for physicians to be mindful of placement of electrodes with respect to critical tissue structures and treatment parameters in order to maintain the non-thermal benefits of electroporation and prevent unnecessary damage to surrounding healthy tissue, critical vascular structures, and/or adjacent organs.},

METHODS: We compared standardized hepatic or renal RFA (laparotomy, 1 cm active tip at 70 ± 2 °C for 5 min) and sham procedures without and with administration of 150 nm micelle-like nanoparticle (MNP) anti-IL6 siRNA (DOPE-PEI conjugates, single IP dose 15 min post-RFA, C57Bl mouse:3.5 ug/100ml, Fisher 344 rat: 20 ug/200 ul), RFA/scrambled siRNA, and RFA/empty MNPs. Outcome measures included: local periablational cellular infiltration (α-SMA+ stellate cells), regional hepatocyte proliferation, serum/tissue IL-6 and VEGF levels at 6-72 hr, and distant tumor growth, tumor proliferation (Ki-67) and microvascular density (MVD, CD34) in subcutaneous R3230 and MATBIII breast adenocarcinoma models at 7 days.
RESULTS: For liver RFA, adjuvant MNP anti-IL6 siRNA reduced RFA-induced increases in tissue IL-6 levels, α-SMA+ stellate cell infiltration, and regional hepatocyte proliferation to baseline (p {\textless} 0.04, all comparisons). Moreover, adjuvant MNP anti-IL6- siRNA suppressed increased distant tumor growth and Ki-67 observed in R3230 and MATBIII tumors post hepatic RFA (p{\textless}0.01). Anti-IL6 siRNA also reduced RFA-induced elevation in VEGF and tumor MVD (p {\textless} 0.01). Likewise, renal RFA-induced increases in serum IL-6 levels and distant R3230 tumor growth was suppressed with anti-IL6 siRNA (p {\textless} 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant nanoparticle-encapsulated siRNA against IL-6 can be used to modulate local and regional effects of hepatic RFA to block potential unwanted pro-oncogenic effects of hepatic or renal RFA on distant tumor.},

	abstract = {Image-guided tumor ablation for early stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an accepted non-surgical treatment that provides excellent local tumor control and favorable survival benefit. This review summarizes the recent advances in tumor ablation for HCC. Diagnostic imaging and molecular biology of HCC has recently undergone marked improvements. Second-generation ultrasonography (US) contrast agents, new computed tomography (CT) techniques, and liver-specific contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have enabled the early detection of smaller and inconspicuous HCC lesions. Various imaging-guidance tools that incorporate imaging-fusion between real-time US and CT/MRI, that are now common for percutaneous tumor ablation, have increased operator confidence in the accurate targeting of technically difficult tumors. In addition to radiofrequency ablation (RFA), various therapeutic modalities including microwave ablation, irreversible electroporation, and high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation have attracted attention as alternative energy sources for effective locoregional treatment of HCC. In addition, combined treatment with RFA and chemoembolization or molecular agents may be able to overcome the limitation of advanced or large tumors. Finally, understanding of the biological mechanisms and advances in therapy associated with tumor ablation will be important for successful tumor control. All these advances in tumor ablation for HCC will result in significant improvement in the prognosis of HCC patients. In this review, we primarily focus on recent advances in molecular tumor biology, diagnosis, imaging-guidance tools, and therapeutic modalities, and refer to the current status and future perspectives for tumor ablation for HCC.},

This preclinical study evaluates the feasibility and safety of IRE on porcine livers. Altogether, 10 pigs were included. Computed tomography (CT) was used to guide two-needle electrodes that were inserted near the hilus hepatis and gall bladder. Animals were followed-up at 2 hours and at 2, 7 and 14 days post-treatment. During and after μsPEF ablation, electrocardiographs found no cardiovascular events, and contrast CT found no portal vein thrombosis. There was necrosis in the ablation zone. Mild cystic oedema around the gall bladder was found 2 hours post-treatment. Pathological studies showed extensive cell death. There was no large vessel damage, but there was mild endothelial damage in some small vessels. Follow-up liver function tests and routine blood tests showed immediate liver function damage and recovery from the damage, which correlated to the pathological changes. These results indicate that μsPEF ablation affects liver tissue and is less effective in vessels, which enable μsPEFs to ablate central tumour lesions close to the hilus hepatis and near large vessels and bile ducts, removing some of the limitations and contraindications of conventional thermal ablation.},

Immediately after RF treatment, skin samples exhibited RF-induced coagulation columns of thermal injury, separately generated around each microneedle in the dermis. In ex vivo bovine liver tissue, the thermal coagulation columns were found to be concentrated maximally around the pointed tips of each electrode. After a RF conduction time of 2 seconds, the individual areas of thermal coagulation began to converge with neighboring RF-induced coagulation columns; the convergence of coagulation columns was found to start from the tips of neighboring electrodes.},

As a new non-thermal treatment, the use of IRE to ablate tumors in the musculoskeletal system might reduce the incidence of fractures. We aimed to determine the ablation threshold of cortical bone and to evaluate the medium- and long-term healing process and mechanical properties of the femur in a rabbit model post-IRE ablation. The ablation threshold of cortical bone was between 1090 V/cm and 1310 V/cm (120 pulses). IRE-ablated femurs displayed no detectable fracture but did exhibit signs of recovery, including osteoblast regeneration, angiogenesis and bone remodeling. In the ablation area, revascularization appeared at 4 weeks post-IRE. Osteogenic activity peaked 8 weeks post-IRE and remained high at 12 weeks. The mechanical strength decreased briefly 4 weeks post-IRE but returned to normal levels within 8 weeks. Our experiment revealed that IRE ablation preserved the structural integrity of the bone cortex, and the ablated bone was able to regenerate rapidly. IRE may hold unique promise for in situ bone tissue ablation because rapid revascularization and active osteogenesis in the IRE ablation area are possible.},

	abstract = {Irreversible electroporation is a fast-growing liver ablation technique. Although safety has been well documented in small ablations, our aim is to assess its safety and feasibility when a large portion of liver is ablated. Eighty-seven mice were subjected to high voltage pulses directly delivered across parallel plate electrodes comprising around 40\% of mouse liver. One group consisted in 55 athymic-nude, in which a tumor from the KM12C cell line was grown and the other thirty-two C57-Bl6 non-tumoral mice. Both groups were subsequently divided into subsets according to the delivered field strength (1000 V/cm, 2000 V/cm) and whether or not they received anti-hyperkalemia therapy. Early mortality (less than 24 hours post-IRE) in the 2000 V/cm group was observed and revealed considerably higher mean potassium levels. In contrast, the animals subjected to a 2000 V/cm field treated with the anti-hyperkalemia therapy had higher survival rates (OR = 0.1, 95\%CI = 0.02-0.32, p {\textless} 0.001). Early mortality also depended on the electric field magnitude of the IRE protocol, as mice given 1000 V/cm survived longer than those given 2000 V/cm (OR = 4.7, 95\%CI = 1.8-11.8, p = 0.001). Our findings suggest that ionic disturbances, mainly due to potassium alterations, should be warned and envisioned when large volume ablations are performed by IRE.},

A strict and objective research process is conducted that comprises a systematic and comprehensive literature search in accordance with predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria, and an assessment of the risk of bias of the selected literature. SRs require a multidisciplinary approach that necessitates cooperation with clinical experts, methodologists, other experts, and statisticians. A meta-analysis (MA) is a statistical method of quantitatively synthesizing data, where possible, from the primary literature selected for the SR. Review articles differ from SRs in that they lack a systematic methodology such as a literature search, selection of studies according to strict criteria, assessment of risk bias, and synthesis of the study results. The importance of evidence-based medicine (EBM) in the decision-making for public policy has recently been increasing thanks to the realization that it should be based on scientific research data. SRs and MAs are essential for EBM strategy and evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. This review addresses the current trends in SRs and MAs in the field of hepatology via a search of recently published articles in the Cochrane Library and Ovid-MEDLINE.},

	abstract = {Metastatic spread of the primary is still defined as the systemic stage of disease in treatment guidelines for various solid tumors. This definition is the rationale for systemic therapy. Interestingly and despite the concept of systemic involvement, surgical resection as a local treatment has proven to yield long-term outcomes in a subset of patients with limited metastatic disease, supporting the concept of oligometastatic disease. Radiofrequency ablation has yielded favorable outcomes in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal metastases, and some studies indicate its prognostic potential in combined treatments with systemic therapies. However, some significant technical limitations apply, such as size limitation, heat sink effects, and unpredictable heat distribution to adjacent risk structures. Interventional and non-invasive radiotherapeutic techniques may overcome these limitations, expanding the options for oligometastatic patients and cytoreductive concepts. Current data suggest very high local control rates even in large tumors at any given location in the human body. The article focusses on the characteristics and possibilities of stereotactic body radiation therapy, interstitial high-dose-rate brachytherapy, and Yttrium-90 radioembolization. In this article, we discuss the differences of the technical preferences as well as their impact on indications. Current data is presented and discussed with a focus on application in oligometastatic or cytoreductive concepts in different tumor biologies.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12957-015-0516-7},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) are treatment methods for patients with early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who are not suitable for surgery. Although some reports indicate that RFA is better than PEI, results from previous reviews and analyses are inconsistent. Therefore, this meta-analysis was performed to more thoroughly evaluate the effects of these treatments in patients with HCC.
METHODS: A literature search was conducted using the Excerpta Medica dataBASE, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, the American Society of Clinical Oncology database, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure database, the Wanfang database, the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and the Chongqing VIP database without language limitations. The primary outcome evaluated was overall survival, and secondary outcomes included complete response and local recurrence. Comparisons were made between Asian and European studies.
RESULTS: Total pooled and subgroup analyses of Asian studies that included selection biases revealed that RFA is superior to PEI with respect to overall survival (hazard ratio (HR), 0.54; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.37 to 0.80; P {\textless} 0.01) and complete response (relative risk (RR), 1.10; 95\% CI 1.03 to 1.18; P {\textless} 0.01). However, no significant difference was observed between RFA and PEI in the European studies. In Asian studies, RFA was associated with a lower local recurrence rate than PEI at 1 year (RR, 0.44; 95\% CI 0.20 to 0.95; P {\textless} 0.05) and 3 years (RR, 0.35; 95\% CI 0.22 to 0.55; P {\textless} 0.01). However, local recurrence was significantly lower after only 3 years in European studies (RR, 0.50; 95\% CI 0.32 to 0.78; P {\textless} 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: RFA was only superior to PEI in Asian studies that included selection bias. Thus, there is insufficient evidence to support the idea that RFA is superior to PEI for patients with cirrhotic HCC. Additional large-scale, multicenter, randomized controlled trials that control for selection bias are needed to fully elucidate the optimal treatment method for HCC.},

In developing countries, viral hepatitis represent the major risk factor, whereas in developed countries, the epidemic of obesity, diabetes and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis contribute to the observed increase in HCC incidence. Cirrhotic patients are recommended to undergo HCC surveillance by abdominal ultrasounds at 6-mo intervals. The current diagnostic algorithms for HCC rely on typical radiological hallmarks in dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging, while the use of α-fetoprotein as an independent tool for HCC surveillance is not recommended by current guidelines due to its low sensitivity and specificity. Early diagnosis is crucial for curative treatments. Surgical resection, radiofrequency ablation and liver transplantation are considered the cornerstones of curative therapy, while for patients with more advanced HCC recommended options include sorafenib and trans-arterial chemo-embolization. A multidisciplinary team, consisting of hepatologists, surgeons, radiologists, oncologists and pathologists, is fundamental for a correct management.

In this study, we examined whether statin use is associated with additional benefits among patients who received curative treatments (CTs) such as surgery, percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), and radiofrequency ablation (RFA).We conducted a cohort study using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Data linked to the Taiwan Cancer Registry in 2001 to 2012. The patient cohort consisted of those who received different treatments, and we compared patients who received statins with those who did not. Statin users were defined as patients who received {\textgreater}28 cumulative defined daily doses after their HCC diagnosis. We used a time-dependent Cox proportional method to model the time from the HCC diagnosis to any death and HCC death between men who received statins and those who did not after adjusting for confounders. Data on statin prescriptions were collected every 6 months to define the user status.In total, 18,892 patients were included, and the mean follow-up duration was 1.74 years. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of all-cause deaths increased in HCC patients who received RFA/PEI compared to those who received surgery (P {\textless} 0.0001 and P {\textless} 0.05, with aHRs of 1.81 and 1.16, respectively, for hepatitis B virus [HBV] or non-HBV HCC). However, with the addition of statin use to RFA or PEI, the overall survival was statistically equal.Surgical resection is still superior over other therapies. If HCC patients cannot meet the criteria for surgery, the addition of statin use to RFA or PEI might improve HCC survival.},

The study protocol was registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02816944). Twenty-six patients were consecutively and prospectively hospitalized for EUS-guided interventional treatment of refractory malignant left-sided liver tumors between June 2014 and June 2016. Liver masses were detected using EUS in 25 of 26 (96.2\%) patients. EUS-guided interventional treatment was completed uneventfully in 23 of 26 (88.5\%) patients using anhydrous ethanol injection (n = 10) or iodine-125 seed implantation (n = 13). Six months later, complete response was achieved in 15 of 23 (65.2\%) patients and partial response in 8 of 23 (34.8\%) patients. Patients with tumor residual have second-look EUS-guided interventional treatment (n = 5), radiotherapy (n = 2) or surgical resection (n = 1). Complete response was achieved after repeated interventional treatment in 3 of 5 patients who underwent second EUS-guided intervention; 2 patients required additional surgical resection but one succeed. No significant complications occurred. Therefore EUS-guided 125I seed brachytherapy is an effective and safe treatment modality for radical operation or promising palliative control of malignant left-sided liver tumors refractory to trans-abdominal intervention.},

A growing body of evidence indicates that inflammation is closely associated with the initiation, progression, and metastasis of many tumors, including those of gastric cancer. In addition, approximately 60\% of the world's population is colonized by Helicobacter pylori, which accounts for more than 50\% of gastric cancers. While the role of inflammation in intestinal and colonic cancers is relatively well defined, its role in stomach neoplasia is still unclear because of the limited access of pathogens to the acidic environment and the technical difficulties isolating and characterizing immune cells in the stomach, especially in animal models. In this review, we will provide recent updates addressing how inflammation is involved in gastric malignancies, and what immune characteristics regulate the pathogenesis of stomach cancer. Also, we will discuss potential therapeutics that target the immune system for the efficient treatment of gastric cancer.},

To compare survival outcome of radiofrequency (RF) ablation and surgical resection (SR) for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ≤ 2 cm.
Materials and Methods
In this retrospective study, patients from the US National Cancer Database with HCC ≤ 2 cm received RF ablation or SR as sole treatment. Overall survival (OS) was compared using log-rank test, multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression, and propensity score matched analysis.
Results
Of 833 patients included, 620 received RF ablation and 213 received SR. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates were 90\%, 64\%, and 47\% for RF ablation and 89\%, 75\%, and 62\% for SR. On univariate analyses, patients who received SR had longer OS than patients who received RF ablation, but this did not achieve statistical significance (P = .113). On multivariate analyses, female sex (HR = 0.700; 95\% CI, 0.501–0.979; P = .037), African American (HR = 0.611; 95\% CI, 0.398–0.938; P = .024) and Asian ethnicity (HR = 0.427; 95\% CI, 0.230–0.790; P = .007), and median income ≥ \$48,000 (HR = 0.695; 95\% CI, 0.518–0.932; P = .015) were associated with longer OS, whereas higher Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores (HR = 1.023; 95\% CI, 1.009–1.037; P = .001) were associated with shorter OS. After matching on age, sex, ethnicity, MELD score, and income, there was no significant difference in OS between the 2 treatment groups (log-rank P = .646).
Conclusions
There was no significant difference in OS between RF ablation and SR in treatment of HCC measuring ≤ 2 cm.},

	abstract = {Purpose
To determine the safety of an approach to immunologically enhance local treatment of hepatocellular cancer (HCC) by combining nonlethal radiation, local regional therapy with intratumoral injection, and systemic administration of a potent Toll-like receptor (TLR) immune adjuvant.

Methods
Patients with HCC not eligible for liver transplant or surgery were subject to: 1) 3 fractions of 2-Gy focal nonlethal radiation to increase tumor antigen expression, 2) intra-/peri-tumoral (IT) injection of the TLR3 agonist, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid polylysine carboxymethylcellulose (poly-ICLC), to induce an immunologic “danger” response in the tumor microenvironment with local regional therapy, and 3) systemic boosting of immunity with intramuscular poly-ICLC. Primary end points were safety and tolerability; secondary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years.

Results
Eighteen patients with HCC not eligible for surgery or liver transplant were treated. Aside from 1 embolization-related severe adverse event, all events were ≤grade II. PFS was 66\% at 6 months, 39\% at 12 months, and 28\% at 24 months. Overall 1-year survival was 69\%, and 2-year survival 38\%. In patients {\textless}60 years old, 2-year survival was 62.5\% vs. 11.1\% in patients aged {\textgreater}60 years (P{\textless}0.05). Several patients had prolonged PFS and OS.

Conclusion
Intra-tumoral injection of the TLR3 agonist poly-ICLC in patients with HCC is safe and tolerable when combined with local nonlethal radiation and local regional treatment. Further work is in progress to evaluate if this approach improves survival compared to local regional treatment alone and characterize changes in anticancer immunity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a promising technique for the focal treatment of pathologic tissues, which involves placing minimally invasive electrodes within the targeted region. However, the knowledge about the therapeutic efficacy and immune reactions in response to IRE remains in its infancy.
METHODS: In this work, to detect whether tumor ablation with IRE could trigger the immunologic response, we developed an osteosarcoma rat model and applied IRE directly to ablate the tumor. In the experiment, 118 SD rats were randomized into 4 groups: the control, sham operation, surgical resection, and IRE groups. Another 28 rats without tumor cell implantation served as the normal non-tumor-bearing group. We analyzed the changes in T lymphocyte subsets, sIL-2R and IL-10 levels in the peripheral blood one day before operation, as well as at 1, 3, 7,14 and 21 days after the operation. Moreover, splenocytes were assayed for IFN-γ and IL-4 production using intracellular cytokine staining one day before the operation, as well as at 7 and 21 days after operation.
RESULTS: We found that direct IRE completely ablated the tumor cells. A significant increase in peripheral lymphocytes, especially CD3(+) and CD4(+) cells, as well as an increased ratio of CD4(+)/CD8(+) were detectable 7 days after operation in both the IRE and surgical resection groups. Compared with the surgical resection group, the IRE group exhibited a stronger cellular immune response. The sIL-2R level of the peripheral blood in the IRE group decreased with time and was significantly different from that in the surgical resection group. Moreover, ablation with IRE significantly increased the percentage of IFN-γ-positive splenocytes.
CONCLUSION: These findings indicated that IRE could not only locally destroy the tumor but also change the status of cellular immunity in osteosarcoma-bearing rats. This provides experimental evidence for the clinical application of IRE in osteosarcoma treatment.},

	abstract = {The roles of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes in mediating cancer progression are well recognized, but a multidimensional analysis of the entire cancer immune system is lacking. Here, we dissected the cancer-immune landscape in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) across tumor, nontumor, and peripheral blood cells using time-of-flight mass cytometry, multiplex immunofluorescence tissue staining, and NanoString analysis. We identified various immune subsets that were enriched in the tumor microenvironment and their potential impact on the tumor immunity based on their detailed phenotypes. This study has validated the concept of a cancer-immune gradient and demonstrated in primary HCC that immune-cell subsets become progressively suppressive as they traverse the nontumor to tumor microenvironment. These data have opened avenues for the design of immunotherapeutics in HCC., The recent development of immunotherapy as a cancer treatment has proved effective over recent years, but the precise dynamics between the tumor microenvironment (TME), nontumor microenvironment (NTME), and the systemic immune system remain elusive. Here, we interrogated these compartments in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using high-dimensional proteomic and transcriptomic analyses. By time-of-flight mass cytometry, we found that the TME was enriched in regulatory T cells (Tregs), tissue resident memory CD8+ T cells (TRMs), resident natural killer cells (NKRs), and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). This finding was also validated with immunofluorescence staining on Foxp3+CD4+ and PD-1+CD8+ T cells. Interestingly, Tregs and TRMs isolated from the TME expressed multiple markers for T-cell exhaustion, including PD-1, Lag-3, and Tim-3 compared with Tregs and TRMs isolated from the NTME. We found PD-1+ TRMs were the predominant T-cell subset responsive to anti–PD-1 treatment and significantly reduced in number with increasing HCC tumor progression. Furthermore, T-bet was identified as a key transcription factor, negatively correlated with PD-1 expression on memory CD8+ T cells, and the PD-1:T-bet ratio increased upon exposure to tumor antigens. Finally, transcriptomic analysis of tumor and adjacent nontumor tissues identified a chemotactic gradient for recruitment of TAMs and NKRs via CXCR3/CXCL10 and CCR6/CCL20 pathways, respectively. Taken together, these data confirm the existence of an immunosuppressive gradient across the TME, NTME, and peripheral blood in primary HCC that manipulates the activation status of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes and renders them immunocompromised against tumor cells. By understanding the immunologic composition of this gradient, more effective immunotherapeutics for HCC may be designed.},

In our study, we sought to identify sncRNAs in various stages of development of HCC. We obtained publicly available small RNA-seq data derived from patients with cirrhosis (n = 14), low-grade dysplastic nodules (LGDN, n = 9), high grade dysplastic nodules (HGDN, n = 6), early hepatocellular carcinoma (eHCC, n = 6), and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, n = 20), along with healthy liver tissue samples (n = 9). All samples were analyzed for various types of non-coding RNAs using PartekFlow software. We remapped small RNA-seq to miRBase to obtain differential expressions of miRNAs and found 87 in cirrhosis, 106 in LGDN, 59 in HGDN, 80 in eHCC, and 133 in HCC. Pathway analysis of miRNAs obtained from diseased samples compared to normal samples showed signaling pathways in the microRNA dependent EMT, CD44, and others. Additionally, we analyzed the data sets for piRNAs, lncRNAs, circRNAs, and sno/mt-RNAs. We validated the in silico data using human HCC samples with NanoString miRNA global expression. Our results suggest that publically available data is a valuable resource for sncRNA identification in HCC progression (FDR set to {\textless}0.05 for all samples) and that a data mining approach is useful for biomarker development.},

Despite four decades of research, insight into host determinants underlying these distinct clinical phases—immunotolerant, immune active, inactive carrier, and HBeAg-negative hepatitis–remains elusive. We performed an in-depth transcriptome analysis of archived FFPE liver biopsies of each clinical phase to address host determinants associated with the natural history. Therefore, we determined, for the first time, intrahepatic global expression profiles of well-characterized chronic HBV patients at different clinical phases. Our data, obtained by microarray, demonstrate that B cells and NK/cytotoxic-related genes in the liver, including CD19, TNFRSF13C, GZMH, and KIR2DS3, were differentially expressed across the clinical HBV phases, which was confirmed by modular analysis and also Nanostring arrays in an independent cohort. Compared to the immunotolerant phase, 92 genes were differentially expressed in the liver during the immune active phase, 46 in the inactive carrier phase, and 71 in the HBeAg-negative phase. Furthermore, our study also revealed distinctive transcription of genes associated with cell cycle activity, NF-κB signaling, cytotoxic function and mitochondrial respiration between clinical phases. Our data define for the first time using microarray unique transcriptomes in the HBV-infected liver during consecutive clinical phases. We demonstrate that fluctuations of viral loads and liver damage coincide with fluctuations in the liver transcriptome and point to functional- immune and non-immune- components contributing to the clinical phenotype in patients.},

Exhausted CD8 T (Tex) cells are immunotherapy targets in chronic infection and cancer, but a comprehensive assessment of Tex cell diversity in human disease is lacking. Here, we developed a transcriptomic- and epigenetic-guided mass cytometry approach to define core exhaustion-specific genes and disease-induced changes in Tex cells in HIV and human cancer. Single-cell proteomic profiling identified 9 distinct Tex cell clusters using phenotypic, functional, transcription factor, and inhibitory receptor co-expression patterns. An exhaustion severity metric was developed and integrated with high-dimensional phenotypes to define Tex cell clusters that were present in healthy subjects, common across chronic infection and cancer or enriched in either disease, linked to disease severity, and changed with HIV therapy. Combinatorial patterns of immunotherapy targets on different Tex cell clusters were also defined. This approach and associated datasets present a resource for investigating human Tex cell biology, with implications for immune monitoring and immunomodulation in chronic infections, autoimmunity, and cancer.},

Among all, aldo-keto reductase family 1 member B10, and IGF2 mRNA-binding protein 3 were found strictly HCC-specific with no expression in 18/20 normal tissues. Target peptides for vaccine design were predicted for both proteins associated with the most prevalent HLA-class I and II alleles.

Aim of this study was to identify the circulating and tissue components of the microenvironment immune-mediated response affecting the aggressiveness and the ensuing clinical outcome. We analyzed the baseline paired HCC and the surrounding tissue biopsies from a prospective cohort of 132 patients at the first diagnosis of HCC for immunolocalization of PD-1/PD-L1, FoxP3, E-cadherin, CLEC2 and for a panel of 82 microRNA associated with regulation of angiogenesis, cell proliferation, cell signaling, immune control and autophagy. Original microarray data were also explored. Serum samples were analyzed for a panel of 19 cytokines. Data were associated with biochemical data, histopathology and survival. Patients with a more aggressive disease and shorter survival, who we named fast-growing accordingly to the tumor doubling time, at presentation had significantly higher AFP levels, TGF-β1 and Cyphra 21-1 levels. Transcriptomic analysis evidenced a significant downregulation of CLEC2 and upregulation of several metalloproteinases. A marked local upregulation of both PD-1 and PD-L1, a concomitant FoxP3-positive lymphocytic infiltrate, a loss of E-cadherin, gain of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype and extreme poor differentiation at histology were also present. Upregulated microRNA in fast-growing HCCs are associated with TGF-β signaling, angiogenesis and inflammation. Our data show that fast HCCs are characterized not only by redundant neo-angiogenesis but also by unique features of distinctively immunosuppressed microenvironment, prominent EMT, and clear-cut activation of TGFβ1 signaling in a general background of long-standing and permanent inflammatory state.},

In sharp contrast, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) formed stable contacts in tumors expressing their cognate antigen. Similar behaviors were observed during effector functions in lymph nodes. In vitro, contacts between NK cells and their targets were cytotoxic but did not elicit sustained calcium influx nor adhesion, whereas CTL contact stability was critically dependent on extracellular calcium entry.

	abstract = {Background:
Liver cancer makes up a huge percentage of cancer mortality worldwide. Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a relatively new minimally invasive nonthermal ablation technique for tumors that applies short pulses of high frequency electrical energy to irreversibly destabilize cell membrane to induce tumor cell apoptosis.

Methods:
This review aims to investigate the studies regarding the use of IRE treatment in liver tumors and metastases to liver. We searched PubMed for all of IRE relevant English language articles published up to September 2016. They included clinical trials, experimental studies, observational studies, and reviews. This review manuscript is nothing with ethics issues and ethical approval is not provided.

Results:
In recent years, increasingly more studies in both preclinical and clinical settings have been conducted to examine the safety and efficacy of this new technique, shedding light on the crucial advantages and disadvantages that IRE possesses. Unlike the current leading thermal ablation techniques, such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA), and cryoablation, IRE requires shorter ablation time without damaging adjacent important vital structures.

Conclusion:
Although IRE has successfully claimed its valuable status in the field of hepatic cancer treatment both preclinical and clinical settings. In order to systemically test and establish its safety and efficacy for clinical applications, more studies still need to be conducted.},

To compare short-, mid-, and long-term follow-up ablation zone volume alterations as well as imaging features on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) after irreversible electroporation (IRE) of primary and secondary liver tumors with findings subsequent to radiofrequency ablation (RFA).

Materials and Methods
Volume assessment of 39 ablation zones (19 RFA, 20 IRE) after intervention was performed at four time intervals (day 0 [t1; n = 39], day 1–7 [t2; n = 25], day 8–55 [t3; n = 28], after day 55 [t4; n = 23]) on dual-phase CT. Analysis of peripheral rim enhancement was conducted. Lesion's volume decrease relative to the volume at t1 was calculated and statistically analyzed with respect to patient's sex, age, ablation modality (IRE/RFA), and history of platinum-based chemotherapy (PCT).

Results
No influence of patient's sex or age on ablation volume was detected. The decrease in ablation zones' volume was significantly larger (p {\textless} 0.05 for all time intervals) after IRE (arterial phase, 7.5\%; venous phase, 9.7\% of initial volume) compared to RFA (arterial phase, 39.6\%; venous phase, 45.3\% of initial volume). After RFA, significantly smaller decreases in the ablation volumes, in general, were detected in patients treated with PCT in their history (p = 0.004), which was not detected after IRE (p = 0.288). In the arterial phase, peripheral rim enhancement was frequently detected after both IRE and RFA. In the venous phase, rim-enhancement was depicted significantly more often following IRE at t1 and t2 (pt1 = 0.003, pt2 {\textless} 0.001).

Conclusion
As per our analysis, ablation zone volume decreased significantly in a more rapid and more profound manner after IRE. Lesion's remodeling after RFA but not IRE seems to be influenced by PCT, possibly due to the type of cell death induced by the different ablation modalities.},

	abstract = {Background
Percutaneous ablation techniques offer a vast armamentarium for local, minimally invasive treatment of liver tumors, nowadays representing an established therapeutic option, which is integrated in treatment algorithms, especially for non-resectable liver tumors. The results of ablative treatment compare very well to surgical treatment in liver lesions, and confirm that these techniques are a valuable option for bridging for transplantation. Different techniques have been established to perform tumor ablation, and the feasibility varies according to the procedure and technical skills of the operator, depending on the size and location of the liver lesion. In recent years, stereotactic multi-needle techniques using 3D trajectory planning, general anesthesia, and tube disconnection during needle placement have had a strong impact on the application range of ablation for liver tumors.

Conclusion
It is well known that creating a sufficient ablation margin and overlapping ablation zones is one key issue to enable ablation of large liver lesions with tumor-free margins (A0 ablation in analogy to R0 resection). Image fusion during treatment and follow-up assure highly accurate staging procedures and interventional planning.

Guided cryoablation via many imaging methods induces iceball formation and tumor necrosisand is an attractive option for treating unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and metastatic liver cancer. There are several advantages to using cryoablation for the treatment of liver cancer: it can be performed percutaneously, intraoperatively, and laparoscopically; iceball formation can be monitored; it has little impact on nearby large blood vessels; and it induces a cryo-immunological response in situ. Clinically, primary research has shown that percutaneous cryoablation of liver cancer is relatively safe and efficient, and it can be combined with other methods, such as radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and immunology, to control disease.

	abstract = {Background: It is now clearly evident that cancer outcome and response to therapy is guided by diverse immune-cell activity in tumors. Presently, a key challenge is to comprehensively identify networks of distinct immune-cell signatures present in complex tissue, at higher-resolution and at various stages of differentiation, activation or function. This is particularly so for closely related immune-cells with diminutive, yet critical, differences.
Results: To predict networks of infiltrated distinct immune-cell phenotypes at higher resolution, we explored an integrated knowledge-based approach to select immune-cell signature genes integrating not only expression enrichment across immune-cells, but also an automatic capture of relevant immune-cell signature genes from the literature. This knowledge-based approach was integrated with resources of immune-cell specific protein networks, to define signature genes of distinct immune-cell phenotypes. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by profiling signatures of distinct immune-cells, and networks of immune-cells, from metastatic melanoma patients who had undergone chemotherapy. The resultant bioinformatics strategy complements immunohistochemistry from these tumors, and predicts both tumor-killing and immunosuppressive networks of distinct immune-cells in responders and non-responders, respectively. The approach is also shown to capture differences in the immune-cell networks of BRAF versus NRAS mutated metastatic melanomas, and the dynamic changes in resistance to targeted kinase inhibitors in MAPK signalling.
Conclusions: This integrative bioinformatics approach demonstrates that capturing the protein network signatures and ratios of distinct immune-cell in the tumor microenvironment maybe an important factor in predicting response to therapy. This may serve as a computational strategy to define network signatures of distinct immune-cells to guide immuno-pathological discovery.},

Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of DC-CIK cell treatment in patients with advanced cancer. A paired study including 57 patients treated with DC-CIK cells (DC-CIK group) and 33 patients treated with best supportive care alone (BSC group) was performed. The patients in the DC-CIK group were matched to those in the control group in terms of sex, age, tumor type and clinical stage. T-cell subsets were detected and overall survival (OS) was compared between the two groups. The results demonstrated that CD4+/CD25+ and CD8+/CD28− subsets significantly decreased following DC-CIK immunotherapy (P{\textless}0.05). The CD3+, CD3+/CD8+, CD8+/CD28+ and CD3+/CD56+ T-cell subsets were significantly increased in the DC-CIK group compared with the BSC group, while the CD8+/CD28− subset was significantly decreased. Univariate analysis demonstrated that a lower CD8+/CD28− and a higher CD8+/CD28+ ratio were associated with prolonged OS in advanced cancer patients. In addition, DC-CIK treatment administration, age ({\textgreater}60 vs. {\textless}60 years), clinical stage and the frequency of CIK treatment significantly affected the OS of patients in the DC-CIK group. A CD8+/CD28− ratio of {\textless}21.12 was found to decrease the hazard ratio (HR) of OS to 0.50 [95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.29–0.87] and a CD8+/CD28+ ratio {\textgreater}9.04 was found to decrease the HR of OS to 0.45 (95\% CI: 0.21–0.98). No serious side effects were observed in the DC-CIK group. Taken together, these data indicate that DC-CIK infusions were able to change the ratios of the T-cell subsets, which increased the T helper cell and cytotoxic T lymphocyte subsets, while it decreased regulatory T lymphocyte subsets. Thus, this method of immunotherapy was found to improve the imbalance in the immune system and prolong the OS in patients with advanced cancer.},

	abstract = {Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common and aggressive human cancers worldwide. HCC is an example of inflammation-related cancer and represents a paradigm of the relation occurring between tumor microenvironment and tumor development. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are a major component of leukocyte infiltrate of tumors and play a pivotal role in tumor progression of inflammation-related cancer, including HCC. Several studies indicate that, in the tumor microenvironment, TAMs acquire an M2-polarized phenotype and promote angiogenesis, metastasis, and suppression of adaptive immunity through the expression of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and matrix metalloproteases. Indeed, an established M2 macrophage population has been associated with poor prognosis in HCC. The molecular links that connect cancer cells and TAMs are not completely known, but recent studies have demonstrated that NF-B, STAT-3, and HIF-1 signaling pathways play key roles in this crosstalk. In this paper, we discuss the current knowledge about the role of TAMs in HCC development, highlighting the role of TAM-derived cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors in the initiation and progression of liver cancer and outlining the signaling pathways involved in the interplay between cancer cells and TAMs.},

The major forms of primary liver cancer are hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA). Both these tumors develop against a background of cirrhotic liver, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, chronic liver damage and fibrosis. HCC is a heterogeneous disease which usually develops within liver cirrhosis related to various etiologies: hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (frequent in Asia and Africa), hepatitis C virus (HCV), chronic alcohol abuse, or metabolic syndrome (frequent in Western countries). In cirrhosis, hepatocarcinogenesis is a multi-step process where pre-cancerous dysplastic macronodules transform progressively into HCC. The patterns of genomic alterations observed in these tumors were recently identified and were instrumental for the identification of potential targeted therapies that could improve patient care. Liver cancer stem cells are a small subset of undifferentiated liver tumor cells, responsible for cancer initiation, metastasis, relapse and chemoresistance, enriched and isolated according to immunophenotypic and functional properties: cell surface proteins (CD133, CD90, CD44, EpCAM, OV-6, CD13, CD24, DLK1, α2δ1, ICAM-1 and CD47); the functional markers corresponding to side population, high aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity and autofluorescence.

	abstract = {Background
Cancer is both a systemic and a genetic disease. The pathogenesis of cancer might be related to dampened immunity. Host immunity recognizes nascent malignant cells – a process referred to as immune surveillance. Augmenting immune surveillance and suppressing immune escape are crucial in tumor immunotherapy.

Methods
A recombinant plasmid capable of co-expressing granulocyte-macrophage colony- stimulating factor (GM-SCF), interleukin-21 (IL-21), and retinoic acid early transcription factor-1 (Rae-1) was constructed, and its effects determined in a mouse model of subcutaneous liver cancer. Serum specimens were assayed for IL-2 and INF-γ by ELISA. Liver cancer specimens were isolated for Rae-1 expression by RT-PCR and Western blot, and splenocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry.

Results
The recombinant plasmid inhibited the growth of liver cancer and prolonged survival of tumor-loaded mice. Activation of host immunity might have contributed to this effect by promoting increased numbers and cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) following expression of GM-SCF, IL-21, and Rae-1. By contrast, the frequency of regulatory T cells was decreased, Consequently, activated CTL and NK cells enhanced their secretion of INF-γ, which promoted cytotoxicity of NK cells and CTL. Moreover, active CTL showed dramatic secretion of IL-2, which stimulates CTL. The recombinant expression plasmid also augmented Rae-1 expression by liver cancer cells. Rae-1 receptor expressing CTL and NK cells removed liver cancer.

Conclusions
The recombinant expression plasmid inhibited liver cancer by a mechanism that involved activation of cell-mediated immunity and Rae-1 in liver cancer.},

	abstract = {The study of the liver as a lymphoid organ is a growing field fueled by our better knowledge of the different component of the immune system and how they orchestrate an immune-related response. The liver have highly specialized mechanisms of immune tolerance, mainly because is continuously exposed to microbial and environmental antigens, and dietary components from the gut. Accordingly, the liver contains specialized lymphoid subpopulations acting as antigen-presenting cells. Growing evidences show that the liver is also associated with obesity-associated diseases because of its immune-related capacity to sense metabolic stress induced by nutritional surplus. Finally, the liver produces a pletora of neo-antigens being the primary metabolic organ of the body. Common immune mechanisms play a key pathogenetic role in most of acute and chronic liver diseases and in the rejection of liver allografts. Any perturbations of liver-related immune functions have important clinical implications. This issue of the Journal of Autoimmunity is focused on the more recent advances in our knowledge related to the loss of liver tolerance, a paradox for a tolerogenic organ, that leads to overactivation of the innate and adaptive immune response and the development of autoimmune liver diseases, such as autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis. The invited expert review articles capture the underlying immunomolecular mechanisms of the development and progression of autoimmune liver diseases, the novel field of the immune-related “liver-gut” axis influences to the development of liver autoimmunity, the predominant role of genetic factors, and the increasingly effective immuno-therapeutic possibilities.},

	abstract = {Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurs frequently after minimally invasive therapy. The aim of our study was to observe the efficiency and safety of the combined treatment of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) with cellular immunotherapy (CIT) for HCC patients. In our study, 62 patients with HCC who were treated with radical RFA were divided into two groups: RFA alone (32 patients) and RFA/CIT (30 patients). Autologous mononuclear cells were collected from the peripheral blood and separated by apheresis, and then induced into natural killer (NK) cells, γδT cells and cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells. These cells were identified by flow cytometry with their specific antibodies and then were infused intravenously to RFA/CIT patients for three or six courses. The tumor recurrent status of these patients was evaluated with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging every 3 months after RFA. Progression-free survival (PFS), liver function, viral load and adverse effects were examined. The results implied that PFS was higher in RFA/CIT group than that in RFA group. In RFA/CIT group, six courses had better survival prognosis than three courses. Viral load of hepatitis C was decreased in two of three patients without antiviral therapy in RFA/CIT group, but was increased in RFA group. No significant adverse reaction was found in the patients with CIT. In summary, these preliminary results suggest that combination of sequential CIT with RFA for HCC patients was efficient and safe, and may be helpful in the prevention of the recurrence for the patients with HCC after RFA.},

	abstract = {Liver metastases remain a major barrier to successful management of malignant disease, particularly for cancers of the gastrointestinal tract but also for other malignancies, such as breast carcinoma and melanoma. The ability of metastatic cells to survive and proliferate in the liver is determined by the outcome of complex, reciprocal interactions between tumor cells and different local resident subpopulations, including the sinusoidal endothelium, stellate, Kupffer, and inflammatory cells that are mediated through cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix adhesion and the release of soluble factors. Cross-communication between different hepatic resident cells in response to local tissue damage and inflammation and the recruitment of bone marrow cells further enhance this intercellular communication network. Both resident and recruited cells can play opposing roles in the progression of metastasis, and the balance of these divergent effects determines whether the tumor cells will die, proliferate, and colonize the new site or enter a state of dormancy. Moreover, this delicate balance can be tilted in favor of metastasis, if factors produced by the primary tumor precondition the microenvironment to form niches of activated resident cells that promote tumor expansion. This review aims to summarize current knowledge on these diverse interactions and the impact they can have on the clinical management of hepatic metastases.

Mature dendritic cells (DCs), classically activated macrophages (M1), granulocytes, B lymphocytes, aβ and ɣδ T lymphocytes, natural killer T (NKT) cells, and natural killer (NK) cells may be implicated in antitumor immunoprotection. Conversely, tolerogenic DCs, alternatively activated macrophages (M2), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and regulatory T (Tregs) and B cells (Bregs) are capable of suppressing antitumor immune responses. Anti-cancer vaccination is a useful strategy to elicit antitumor immune responses, while overcoming immunosuppressive mechanisms. Whole tumor cells or lysates derived thereof hold more promise as cancer vaccines than individual tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), because vaccinal cells can elicit immune responses to multiple TAAs. Cancer cell-based vaccines can be autologous, allogeneic or xenogeneic. Clinical use of xenogeneic vaccines is advantageous in that they can be most effective in breaking the preexisting immune tolerance to TAAs. To potentiate immunotherapy, vaccinations can be combined with other modalities that target different immune pathways. These modalities include 1) genetic or chemical modification of cell-based vaccines; 2) cross-priming TAAs to T cells by engaging dendritic cells; 3) T-cell adoptive therapy; 4) stimulation of cytotoxic inflammation by non-specific immunomodulators, toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, cytokines, chemokines or hormones; 5) reduction of immunosuppression and/or stimulation of antitumor effector cells using antibodies, small molecules; and 6) various cytoreductive modalities.

	abstract = {Nano-therapeutic cancer immunotherapy using hyperthermia-induced heat shock proteins: insights from mathematical modeling Fang-Chu Lin, Chao-Hsiung Hsu, Yung-Ya Lin  Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA  Background: Nano-therapeutic utilizing hyperthermia therapy in combination with chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation is known to treat various types of cancer. These cancer treatments normally focus on reducing tumor burden. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to confine adequate thermal energy in a tumor and obtain a complete tumor ablation to avoid recurrence and metastasis while leaving normal tissues unaffected. Consequently, it is critical to attain an alternative tumor-killing mechanism to circumvent these challenges. Studies have demonstrated that extracellular heat shock proteins (HSPs) activate antitumor immunity during tumor cell necrosis. Such induced immunity was further shown to assist in regressing tumor and reducing recurrence and metastasis. However, only a narrow range of thermal dose is reported to be able to acquire the optimal antitumor immune outcome. Consequently, it is crucial to understand how extracellular HSPs are generated.Materials and methods: In this work, a predictive model integrating HSP synthesis mechanism and cell death model is proposed to elucidate the HSP involvement in hyperthermia cancer immune therapy and its relation with dead tumor cells. This new model aims to provide insights into the thermally released extracellular HSPs by dead tumor cells for a more extensive set of conditions, including various temperatures and heating duration time.Results: Our model is capable of predicting the optimal thermal parameters to generate maximum HSPs for stimulating antitumor immunity, promoting tumor regression, and reducing metastasis. The obtained nonlinear relation between extracellular HSP concentration and increased dead cell number, along with rising temperature, shows that only a narrow range of thermal dose is able to generate the optimal antitumor immune result.Conclusion: Our predictive model is capable of predicting the optimal temperature and exposure time to generate HSPs involved in the antitumor immune activation, with a goal to promote tumor regression and reduce metastasis.

Signal sequence receptor subunit γ (SSR3), an SSR family member, is heavily involved in cell growth and differentiation and closely associated with many tumor types. However, the role of this protein in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. In this study, we used data from public databases to analyze SSR3 expression in HCC. We subjected 20 pairs of fresh-frozen tissues to quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to investigate SSR3 expression. We also subjected 95 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded HCC tissues to immunohistochemistry to detect SSR3 expression and determine the clinical significance of SSR3 expression in HCC. Bioinformatics analysis and qRT-PCR results showed that compared with that in adjacent normal liver tissues, SSR3 was highly expressed in HCC tissues. High SSR3 expression was positively correlated with tumor size (P{\textless}.01), cancer embolus (P=.01), TNM stages (P=.02) and differentiation grades (P{\textless}.01). Kaplan–Meier and Cox proportional hazards analyses indicated that high SSR3 expression was significantly associated with poor survival in HCC patients and that SSR3 was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in HCC patients. In conclusion, SSR3 acts as an oncogene in HCC and can therefore serve as a biomarker for the prognoses of HCC patients.},

	abstract = {The immune responses elicited following delivery of DNA vaccines to the skin has previously been shown to be significantly enhanced by the addition of electroporation (EP) to the treatment protocol. Principally, EP increases the transfection of pDNA into the resident skin cells. In addition to increasing the levels of in vivo transfection, the physical insult induced by EP is associated with activation of innate pathways which are believed to mediate an adjuvant effect, further enhancing DNA vaccine responses. Here, we have investigated the possible mechanisms associated with this adjuvant effect, primarily focusing on the cell death pathways associated with the skin EP procedure independent of pDNA delivery. Using the minimally invasive CELLECTRA®-3P intradermal electroporation device that penetrates the epidermal and dermal layers of the skin, we have investigated apoptotic and necrotic cell death in relation to the vicinity of the electrode needles and electric field generated. Employing the well-established TUNEL assay, we detected apoptosis beginning as early as one hour after EP and peaking at the 4 hour time point. The majority of the apoptotic events were detected in the epidermal region directly adjacent to the electrode needle. Using a novel propidium iodide in vivo necrotic cell death assay, we detected necrotic events concentrated in the epidermal region adjacent to the electrode. Furthermore, we detected up-regulation of calreticulin expression on skin cells after EP, thus labeling these cells for uptake by dendritic cells and macrophages. These results allow us to delineate the cell death mechanisms occurring in the skin following intradermal EP independently of pDNA delivery. We believe these events contribute to the adjuvant effect observed following electroporation at the skin treatment site.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Local therapies for liver tumors are considered to be safe. However, cryoablation (CA) has been associated with an exaggerated systemic inflammatory response (SIR). Aim of this study was to assess the degree of SIR after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in comparison with major (MR) or minor (mR) liver resection.
Material and methods
Thirty-nine patients were treated with RFA (n=11), MR (n=10) or mR (n=18). SIR parameters [white blood count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP)], proinflammatory mediators [IL-6, TNF-α and sPLA2], liver damage parameters [AST/ALT] and platelet counts were determined at different time points. The volume of ablated liver was calculated on the first CT after RFA in order to correlate ablated liver volume with liver enzyme release and SIR. All data are expressed as median values with quartiles [25\%, 75\%].
Results
RFA induced a moderate SIR, as demonstrated by a significant elevation of CRP (77mg/L vs 3mg/L), IL-6 (96pg/ml vs 4pg/ml) and sPLA2 (41ng/ml vs 7ng/ml, p{\textless}0.05). Peak point values of SIR (WBC and CRP at 24 vs 48h and 48 vs 72h) and proinflammatory response parameters (24 vs 48h) occurred earlier after RFA than after mR or MR. Time-to-time comparison revealed even increased levels of CRP (77mg/L [59, 160]) 24h after RFA when compared to patients undergoing major or minor resection (50mg/L [28, 66] and 59mg/L [24, 91], respectively) and increased levels of IL-6 (67pg/ml [42, 131]) 4h after RFA when compared to patients undergoing minor resection (29pg/ml [20, 55]). Postoperative levels of AST and LDH correlated significantly with the ablated liver volume 1h after RFA (RC=0.860 and RC=0.868, respectively, p{\textless}0.05).
Conclusion
RFA induced a moderate SIR of the same magnitude as in patients undergoing partial liver resection. None of the patients showed signs of an exaggerated SIR, as has been reported after cryoablation.},

	abstract = {An alternative to surgical resection of liver tumors, radio-frequency ablation induces in situ thermal coagulation necrosis through the delivery of high-frequency alternating current to the tissues. Imaging helps to detect treatable lesions, guide the placement of the probe, and assess the effect of therapy. Computed tomography (CT) is used most frequently to determine whether the ablation is complete and to screen for early recurrences that may benefit from reablation. Complete ablation creates an area of necrosis that, at CT, is of low attenuation compared with the surrounding liver tissue, is often homogeneous, and has smooth margins. The most important features are the size of the necrotic defect, which, immediately after treatment, should be larger than that of the pretreatment tumor, and the sharpness of the margins, which indicates an abrupt change in attenuation between the necrotic tissue and surrounding liver tissue. Enhancement, when present, is due to perfusion abnormality or granulation tissue and forms a regular rim or a homogeneous zone at the margin of the defect. It is seen immediately after ablation but may be prolonged. Enhancement is affected by the scanning technique. Over time, the size of the defect remains stable or decreases. Any variation from this general pattern is suggestive of incomplete ablation or recurrence.},

Potentially curative treatment options for HCC include resection, transplantation, and percutaneous ablation, whereas palliative treatments include trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE), radioembolization, and systemic treatments. Due to the diversity of available treatment options and patients’ presentations, a multidisciplinary team should decide clinical management of HCC, according to tumor characteristics and stage of liver disease. Potentially curative treatments are suitable for very-early- and early-stage HCC. However, the vast majority of HCC patients are diagnosed in later stages, where the tumor characteristics or progress of liver disease prevent curative interventions. For patients with intermediate-stage HCC, TACE and radioembolization improve survival and are being evaluated in addition to potentially curative therapies or with systemic targeted therapy. There is currently no effective systemic chemotherapy, immunologic, or hormonal therapy for HCC, and sorafenib is the only approved molecular-targeted treatment for advanced HCC. Other targeted agents are under investigation; trials comparing new agents in combination with sorafenib are ongoing. Combinations of systemic targeted therapies with local treatments are being evaluated for further improvements in HCC patient outcomes. This article provides an updated and comprehensive overview of the current standards and trends in the treatment of HCC.},

However, the scientific effort devoted on the development of cancer immunotherapy has not been translated into the expected clinical success. On the contrary, classical antineoplastic treatments such as surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy are the first line of treatment. Nevertheless, there is compelling evidence on the immunogenicity of cancer cells and the capacity of the immune system to expand cancer-specific effector cytotoxic T cells. However, the effective activation of anticancer T cell responses strongly depends on efficient tumour antigen presentation from professional antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells (DCs). Several strategies have been used to boost DC antigen presenting functions, but at the end cancer immunotherapy is not as effective as would be expected according to preclinical models. In this review, we comment on these discrepancies, focusing our attention on the contribution of regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells to the lack of therapeutic success of DC-based cancer immunotherapy.},

While many chemotherapeutic agents can eﬃciently eliminate cancer cells, longterm protection against cancer is not achieved and many patients experience cancer recurrence. Mobilizing and stimulating the immune system against tumor cells is one of the most eﬀective ways to protect against cancers that recur and/or metastasize. Activated tumor speciﬁc cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) can seek out and destroy metastatic tumor cells and reduce tumor lesions. Natural Killer (NK) cells are a front-line defense against drugresistant tumors and can provide tumoricidal activity to enhance tumor immune surveillance. Cytokines like IFN-γ or TNF play a crucial role in creating an immunogenic microenvironment and therefore are key players in the ﬁght against metastatic cancer. To this end, a group of anthracyclines or treatments like photodynamic therapy (PDT) exert their eﬀects on cancer cells in a manner that activates the immune system. This process, known as immunogenic cell death (ICD), is characterized by the release of membrane-bound and soluble factors that boost the function of immune cells. This review will explore diﬀerent types of ICD inducers, some in clinical trials, to demonstrate that optimizing the cytokine response brought about by treatments with ICD-inducing agents is central to promoting anti-cancer immunity that provides long-lasting protection against disease recurrence and metastasis.},

TILs have been extensively analyzed, and subpopulations of CD3(+), CD4(+), and CD8(+) T cells are often present in HCC. Some studies have reported that the percentage of CD8(+) T cells, which might have cytotoxic activity, is decreased in tumors with TILs, as compared with noncancerous tissues. Although the antitumor effects of TILs seem to be impaired in HCCs, the underlying mechanism has remained unclear until quite recently.

METHODS: We detected CD4(+) CD69(+) CD25(-) T cells and its expression of CCR6 and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) in peripheral blood of 91 HCC patients, 38 chronic hepatitis patients and 34 healthy donors by flow cytometry. CD4(+) CD69(+) CD25(-) T cells in HCC tissues were also analyzed.
RESULTS: CD4(+) CD69(+) CD25(-) T cells were significantly increased in peripheral blood of HCC patients compared with healthy persons and chronic hepatitis patients (8.74\% ± 0.42\% vs 4.55\% ± 0.33\% and 5.15\% ± 0.36\%, P {\textless} 0.0001). The percentage of peripheral CD4(+) CD69(+) CD25(-) T cells was significantly higher in HCC patients with Tumor Node Metastasis (TNM) stage III plus IV (P {\textless} 0.05). Patients with large tumor size and tumor vascular invasion were inclined to obtain high percentage of CD4(+) CD69(+) CD25(-) T cells (P {\textless} 0.05). The frequency of membrane-bound TGF-β1 positive cells in CD4(+) CD69(+) CD25(-) T cells from HCC patients was higher than that from the other two groups (P {\textless} 0.0001). A considerable proportion of CD4(+) CD69(+) CD25(-) T cells were present in HCC tissues, which has significant correlation with tumor size and TNM stage. Few CD4(+) CD69(+) CD25(-) T cells express CCR6 both in peripheral blood and tumor tissues from HCC patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased CD4(+) CD69(+) CD25(-) T cells in HCC patients are significantly correlated with tumor size, vascular invasion and TNM stage. Thus, increased CD4(+) CD69(+) CD25(-) T cells exert a critical role in HCC progression and might be a clinically aggressive phenotype of HCC.},

	abstract = {In the search for tumor-specific antigens, microbial and eukaryotic heat shock proteins (HSP) have been identified. Intracellularly, HSPs function as molecular chaperones supporting folding and transport of a great variety of polypeptides and proteins under normal physiological conditions and following stress stimuli. Furthermore, interferon-γ and elevated body temperature induced by exercise have been found to increase serum levels of HSPs in humans. Extracellularly localized or plasma membrane-bound HSPs elicit a potent anti-cancer immune response mediated either by the adaptive or innate immune system. Following uptake of HSP (HSP70 and gp96)-peptide complexes by antigen presenting cells (APCs) and "cross-presentation” of HSP-chaperoned peptides on MHC class I molecules, a CD8-specific T cell response is induced. Apart from chaperoning tumor-specific peptides, HSPs per se provide activatory signals for the innate immune system. Binding of peptide-free HSP70 to APCs via Toll-like receptors (TLRs) initiates the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and thus results in a broad non-specific immunostimulation. An unusual membrane localization of Hsp70, the major heatinducible member of the HSP70 family, on tumor cells but not on corresponding normal tissues was found to act as a tumor-specific recognition structure for natural killer (NK) cells. Soluble as well as cell membrane-bound HSP70 can directly activate the cytolytic and migratory capacity of NK cells. APCs and tumor cells actively release HSP70s in lipid vesicles with biophysical properties of exosomes. These HSP70-presenting exosomes are thought to stimulate the adaptive and innate immune system in vivo. Taken together, depending on their intra/extracellular localization, peptide loading status, origin and route of application, HSPs either exert immune activation as danger signals in cancer immunity or protect cells from lethal damage induced by exogenous stress stimuli.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a minimally invasive surgical procedure which has widespread popularity in the treatment of hepatic and pancreatic cancers. Increased evidence indicates that RFA stimulates anti-tumor immunity, possibly through the induction heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) expression. HSP70 has the capacity to affect the immunogenicity of tumor cells, to chaperone antigenic peptides and deliver these into antigen presentation pathways within antigen-presenting cells, and to activate and regulate innate and adaptive immunity, which makes it useful in immunotherapeutic strategies for the treatment of cancers.
DATA SOURCES: An English-language literature search was conducted using MEDLINE (1991-2010) on anti-tumor immunity, heat shock protein 70, radiofrequency ablation, hepatic cancer, pancreatic cancer, and other related subjects.
RESULTS: RFA has an increasing application in the surgical treatment of hepatic and pancreatic cancers. Increased evidence indicates that RFA can induce the expression of HSP70 which possesses properties that enable it to influence a variety of immunological processes. Tumor-derived HSP70 is regarded as a potent adjuvant facilitating presentation of tumor antigens and induction of anti-tumor immunity.
CONCLUSIONS: This review addresses the potential association of RFA, HSP70, and anti-tumor immunity in treatment of hepatic and pancreatic cancers. To establish direct evidence of a potential association of RFA, HSP70, and anti-tumor immunity in hepatic and pancreatic cancers, further investigations should be conducted.},
